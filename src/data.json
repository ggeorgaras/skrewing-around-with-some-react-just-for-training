Extensions like K2, AllVideos, Simple Image Gallery (Free and Pro) or Tabs &amp; Sliders, all with more than one million downloads each.&nbsp;At the same time, we have developed more than 30 extensions for Joomla (both free and commercial), all with a combined download count of nearly 8 million.<br \/><br \/>As we progress into the future, building new &amp; more complex products, while embracing new platforms (WordPress in particular), we must be laser focused on the products that matter most to our vision. And our vision is to offer solid, cross-platform products with a long lifespan, that redefine how we develop websites with Joomla and eventually WordPress. That way you can invest in them and know that they will be supported and improved continuously.<br \/><br \/>So as we move towards more such complex products, we (unfortunately) have to cut down on the resources we spend on extensions that are less important to us, as we really don't wish to become \"Jack of all trades, master of none\".<br \/><br \/>Our goal is to maintain a portfolio of less than 10 products for Joomla and (eventually) WordPress. Less products means we can be more agile when it comes to developing new features in the future.<br \/>","fulltext":"<br \/>Which brings us to \"<strong>Tabs &amp; Sliders<\/strong>\"...<br \/><br \/>Although it's one of the most all-time popular Joomla extensions (1m+ downloads) and probably one of the top 2-3 extensions for Tabs and\/or Sliders in content, we feel we haven't given it the attention it deserves.<br \/><br \/>The fact that Tabs &amp; Sliders has become less important to us does not mean it's less important to its users. And because we value our users and the trust they put in JoomlaWorks products all these years, we would never just kill an extension, especially one that's popular already.<br \/><br \/>That is why&nbsp;we have decided to pass on development to our friends over at <a href=\"https:\/\/www.alledia.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Alledia<\/a>, the folks who also run <a href=\"https:\/\/www.ostraining.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">OSTraining<\/a>, both lead by <a href=\"http:\/\/steveburge.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Steve Burge<\/a>.<br \/><br \/>We believe <strong>Tabs &amp; Sliders<\/strong> is in good hands and the nice folks at Alledia will take good care of it and further extend and improve the product. In fact, they have already unified the plugin and module into one extension, as both already shared the JS scripts that powered the tabs and sliders functionality. Having a unified extension (package in Joomla lingo) will obviously speed up development and also make updating easier.<br \/><br \/>Alledia will of course honor Tabs &amp; Sliders' existing distribution model and they will keep the extension free as it has been for nearly 9 years already.<br \/><br \/>Starting today, you can download the updated&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 15.6px;\">Tabs &amp; Sliders extension from Alledia here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.alledia.com\/extensions\/tabs-and-sliders\/\">https:\/\/www.alledia.com\/extensions\/tabs-and-sliders\/<\/a><br \/><br \/><\/span>We have also updated our XML update definition files to include the new release from Alledia. This means that sites already using Tabs &amp; Sliders (the plugin) will be able to directly update to the new release (including both the plugin and module) supported by Alledia.<br \/><br \/>I'd like to thank Steve Burge for accepting the challenge and I believe he and his team will make Tabs &amp; Sliders even more popular in the years to come.<br \/><br \/><em>P.S.

To give you an idea of how solid K2 is, the previous version (2.6.9) was released in December 2014 and it was 100% compatible with Joomla 3.4.x up until the launch of K2 v2.7.0. A slower release cycle means we are more careful when we issue updates to K2 and this is something we believe firmly.<br \/><br \/>That being said, if we want to properly support third party extension integration with K2, it's best to decouple any such functionality. It's what we did since the inception of K2 in 2009 when we decided to keep the advanced media and image gallery functionalities completely separate in the form of AllVideos and Simple Image Gallery Pro.<br \/><br \/>After so many years, one thing has also proved certain: the continuous support of sh404SEF from <a href=\"http:\/\/anything-digital.com\/\">Anything Digital<\/a> and recently from <a href=\"https:\/\/weeblr.com\/\">Weeblr<\/a> (founded by sh404SEF's original developer, Yannick Gaultier). <a href=\"https:\/\/weeblr.com\/joomla-seo-analytics-security\/sh404sef\">sh404SEF<\/a> is one of the most popular extensions in the Joomla community and it's arguably the best SEO related extension for Joomla.<br \/><br \/>So seeing sh404SEF continuously being updated and improved, we decided to decouple it from K2 in order to follow such changes in sh404SEF's development. As a bonus we also added community requested features for even better URL manipulation and finally we made sure the plugin supports both K2 versions 2.x and the upcoming 3.x. That's one codebase to maintain and from now on it will fall to faster updates, following closely the development of sh404SEF.<br \/><br \/>The new \"K2 Plugin for sh404SEF\" is distributed commercially for two reasons: we can provide dedicated\/personal support and it's a way to give back to the K2 project.<br \/><br \/><a href=\"index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=262:k2-plugin-for-sh404sef&amp;Itemid=774\">\"<span style=\"line-height: 15.6px;\">K2 Plugin for sh404SEF\" is<\/span> now available to purchase in 6 and 12 month subscriptions, starting from 14.90 EUR.<\/a>","fulltext":"","extra_fields":null,"created":"2016-03-29 14:12:28","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2016-03-29 14:29:51","featured":"0","image":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/28232e87509dedeadc0cd2b6a94ea3f5_L.jpg?t=1459261791","imageWidth":"572","image_caption":"","image_credits":"","imageXSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/28232e87509dedeadc0cd2b6a94ea3f5_XS.jpg?t=1459261791","imageSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/28232e87509dedeadc0cd2b6a94ea3f5_S.jpg?t=1459261791","imageMedium":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/28232e87509dedeadc0cd2b6a94ea3f5_M.jpg?t=1459261791","imageLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/28232e87509dedeadc0cd2b6a94ea3f5_L.jpg?t=1459261791","imageXLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/28232e87509dedeadc0cd2b6a94ea3f5_XL.jpg?t=1459261791","video":null,"video_caption":"","video_credits":"","gallery":null,"hits":"13620","category":{"id":"1","name":"Blog","alias":"blog","link":"\/blog","description":"","image":"","ordering":"1"},"tags":[{"id":"256","name":"products","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/products"},{"id":"257","name":"releases","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/releases"},{"id":"61","name":"k2","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/k2"},{"id":"255","name":"sh404sef","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/sh404sef"}],"attachments":[],"votingPercentage":0,"numOfvotes":"(0 votes)","author":{"name":"Fotis","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/user\/989-fotis","avatar":"\/media\/k2\/users\/1563.png","profile":{"id":"1563","gender":"m","description":"","image":"1563.png","url":"","group":"1"}},"numOfComments":"0","events":{"BeforeDisplay":"","AfterDisplay":"","AfterDisplayTitle":"","BeforeDisplayContent":"","AfterDisplayContent":"","K2BeforeDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplayTitle":"","K2BeforeDisplayContent":"","K2AfterDisplayContent":"","K2CommentsCounter":""},"language":"*"},{"id":"260","title":"JoomlaDay Brasil!","alias":"joomladay-brasil","link":"\/blog\/item\/260-joomladay-brasil","catid":"1","introtext":"What a blast, both my first overseas trip and my fist international conference as well.

On the upside we got to see Lisbon as we waited about 10hrs for our flight to Brasilia. We arrived happy and really exhausted but luck was on our side since Paulo and Jorge were waiting for us.

Impeccable organisation, lovely venue and goodies for the speakers.&nbsp;Since the language barrier was an issue in Brasil the idea to include translations in Portuguese worked wonders with the crowd.&nbsp;To be honest I\u2018ve attended multiple events in the past and I can certainly admin that #JDBR15 was one of the best organised.<br \/><br \/>Javier, Roland, Jorge and pretty much all presentations where kick-ass material (at least the ones I could understand).<br \/><br \/><img src=\"images\/blog\/brazil\/_bbq.jpg\" width=\"960\" height=\"540\" alt=\" bbq\" title=\"Amazing Bbq\" \/><br \/>The bbq was fantastic as well.&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>\r\n<h2>The Presentation<\/h2>\r\nTalk about being nervous.

We pulled it through!&nbsp;Once we got up to the stage all the anxiety went away. Seeing people eagerly waiting to hear about v3 relieved the tension. Once we started talking (insert an apology here to the translators) there was no going back. One more presentation and we where off to the workshops.<br \/><br \/>I have to admit, the 3hr workshops where a really nice idea which we are definitely ripping of in a local JoomlaDay :)&nbsp;The ability to learn directly from prominent Joomla! developers and to receive feedback directly from your users is invaluable. I don\u2019t think you can put a price tag on this opportunity. I think this is a must for all upcoming JoomlaDay events.

As it occurs with every other product or technology, there is a time when we have to say goodbye, either because a new better product or technology fulfills our needs or simply because it's not required anymore.<br \/>","fulltext":"<br \/>When K2mart was first released, it introduced a very interesting concept in how we further extend or bridge Joomla extensions. Put simply, it made Virtuemart e-shops look and function a lot better when it came to the product catalog. But as the years have passed, we've seen that Virtuemart's popularity has significantly declined (<a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/trends\/explore#q=virtuemart\">just look at this graph from Google Trends<\/a>) and furthermore, we devote way more time patching bugs caused by constant changes introduced in Virtuemart's codebase, than working on actual features. It's just not worth it anymore. And now's the perfect timing: now that VM is going to version 3 and we know most eshops will probably break trying to upgrade from v2 to v3, it's the best time to simply stop supporting K2mart altogether. To be honest, we never had high hopes for K2mart. It was our pet project, but it was very well executed. And it brought new concepts into K2 which you will see in the coming version 3. We thank our 3,000 customers who built 3,000 K2mart \"bridged\" (as I like to call it) VM eshops. They are probably the most well designed VM shops ever to have been built (thanks to K2 of course).<br \/><br \/>We will of course honor the remaining subscriptions purchased for as long as they last and specifically provide patches and other fixes in Virtuemart v2. As a sidenote, I'd like to say that the new K2 version 3 released soon has integrated lots of programming concepts from K2mart and thus a true eCommerce solution based on K2 alone is on our roadmap for the coming years (perhaps as part of our K2 Pro initiative).<br \/><br \/>We're also bidding adieu to SuperBlogger, a small (but pioneering) content plugin which was released back in 2008. SuperBlogger was released for Joomla 1.5 and integrated the hot Disqus commenting service as well as (then and now) popular social services into a single plugin, which could extend any Joomla website. And because it was the first plugin to introduct the MVC templating pattern for plugins in Joomla (still not possible by default) it could easily transform a typical boring blog section in Joomla into a WordPress-like equivalent. A well known network of tech blogs run entirely on SuperBlogger for as long as they were based on Joomla and it was amazing to see that coming out of a fun little project of mine. SuperBlogger sold around 4,000 subscriptions and it put a sock into WP fanboys' mouths at the time. SuperBlogger was partly the basis for some features in K2 when originally launched.

Let\u2019s say a slideshow or multiple content modules and the list goes on you might want to simplify the search results page.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<h2>The Solution.<\/h2>\r\n<p>The solution would be to create a menu item for these listings so you can control your modules. Guess what.. it is easier than you think, just follow these simple steps.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<h3>Step 1: Create a new menu item<\/h3>\r\n<p>You first need to create a menu item for the results. For maintenance reasons and the sake of clarity I always create a search form or results menu item.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Hint:<\/strong>&nbsp;Leave the Search Term field empty.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Step 2: Copy its id<\/h3>\r\n<p>In this step you need to copy the menu item\u2019s id. You can easily find its id since it is the last parameter in the URL. The image bellow will explain it a lot better if you are still confused.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/blog\/menu-id.png\" alt=\"menu-id\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Example:<\/strong>&nbsp;For a URL like <em>site.com\/administrator\/index.php?option=com_menus&amp;view=item&amp;layout=edit&amp;id=190&nbsp;<\/em><strong>the id would be 190.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<h3>Step 3: The overriding part<\/h3>\r\n<p><strong>If your template already has overrides for the K2 tools modules you can safely ignore this part.<\/strong><br \/><br \/>If you read the <a href=\"index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=84:k2-inheritance-sub-templating&amp;Itemid=112\">K2 inheritance &amp; sub-templating<\/a>&nbsp;post by Yiota, you already know how easy it is to locate the files to override.<br \/>For those of you who didn\u2019t read that post, <a href=\"http:\/\/getk2.org\/documentation\/tutorials\/174-templating-with-k2-and-the-concepts-of-sub-templates\" target=\"_blank\">this piece of documentation<\/a> is quite helpful as well as Yiota\u2019s post.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">The K2 Tools module files are located in the <strong>\/modules\/mod_k2_tools\/<\/strong> folder and the file you need to override is search.php which is located inside the<strong> \/modules\/mod_k2_tools\/tmpl\/ folder<\/strong>.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>Follow the same procedure which is described in these two posts and move this file in your template\u2019s <strong>html\/mod_k2_tools\/ folder<\/strong>. Your final file structure should match the one in the following image.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/blog\/folder-strucutre.png\" alt=\"folder-strucutre\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" height=\"607\" width=\"305\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\r\n<h3>Step 4: Now the coding (and final) part<\/h3>\r\n<p>As you might have already suspected, what we need to do is to make the form's action post in that particular menu item.<\/p>\r\n<p>To achieve this you need to edit the form\u2019s action attribute and append the menu item id you copied in step 2.<\/p>\r\n<p>Is this all Greek to you? No worries just use the following snippet.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>You need to change this line of code<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<pre>&lt;form action=\"&lt;?php echo $action; ?&gt;\" method=\"get\" autocomplete=\"off\" class=\"k2SearchBlockForm\"&gt;<\/pre>\r\n<p><strong>to:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<pre>&lt;form action=\"&lt;?php echo JRoute::_('index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=itemlist&amp;task=search&amp;Itemid=THE_MENU_ITEM_ID'); ?&gt;\" method=\"get\" autocomplete=\"off\" class=\"k2SearchBlockForm\"&gt;<\/pre>\r\n<p>Voila! Now you have a menu item just for your search results. The final thing you might need to do it to publish some modules specifically for this menu item to spice it up a bit but this is completely optional. If are already experienced with PHP you can always tamper with the $action variable.<\/p>\r\n<h3>&nbsp;<\/h3>\r\n<h3>Final Note<\/h3>\r\n<p>Using this method will not only give you the utmost control over your layout. It will also and most importanly help you with a critical element, consitency in your layout.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","extra_fields":null,"created":"2014-05-08 21:00:00","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2015-01-28 16:22:33","featured":"0","image":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/95a78f3015bd19286b33c65657114fc4_L.jpg?t=1422462153","imageWidth":"572","image_caption":"","image_credits":"","imageXSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/95a78f3015bd19286b33c65657114fc4_XS.jpg?t=1422462153","imageSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/95a78f3015bd19286b33c65657114fc4_S.jpg?t=1422462153","imageMedium":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/95a78f3015bd19286b33c65657114fc4_M.jpg?t=1422462153","imageLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/95a78f3015bd19286b33c65657114fc4_L.jpg?t=1422462153","imageXLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/95a78f3015bd19286b33c65657114fc4_XL.jpg?t=1422462153","video":null,"video_caption":"","video_credits":"","gallery":null,"hits":"31782","category":{"id":"1","name":"Blog","alias":"blog","link":"\/blog","description":"","image":"","ordering":"1"},"tags":[{"id":"206","name":"enhancement","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/enhancement"},{"id":"147","name":"development","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/development"}],"attachments":[],"votingPercentage":0,"numOfvotes":"(0 votes)","author":{"name":"Krikor","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/user\/990-krikor","avatar":"\/media\/k2\/users\/1.png","profile":{"id":"1","gender":"m","description":"","image":"1.png","url":"","group":"1"}},"numOfComments":"4","events":{"BeforeDisplay":"","AfterDisplay":"","AfterDisplayTitle":"","BeforeDisplayContent":"","AfterDisplayContent":"","K2BeforeDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplayTitle":"","K2BeforeDisplayContent":"","K2AfterDisplayContent":"","K2CommentsCounter":""},"language":"*"},{"id":"190","title":"Sayonara Joomla LTS!","alias":"sayonara-joomla-lts","link":"\/blog\/item\/190-sayonara-joomla-lts","catid":"1","introtext":"F-i-n-a-l-l-y!&nbsp;Goodbye, adieu, sayonara, \u03ac\u03bd\u03c4\u03b5 \u03b3\u03b5\u03b9\u03b1 &amp; good riddance to Joomla LTS releases!<br \/><br \/>The Joomla team has decided to ditch the Ubuntu style release cycle (a truly WTF decision in the first place) and once and for all end confusion to developers, users, customers and clients from hell.<br \/><br \/>This means that the current release (3.x) is the current stable release.

Together they provide a friendly and powerful interface that works great for both experts and beginners who want to customise their website with minimum effort.<\/p>\r\n<p>In this post we'll take a deeper look in the flexibility provided by <strong>K2<\/strong> when it comes to customisation, either through its multiple sub-template capabilities or through the inheritance options provided in its parameters.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<h2>Customizing K2 using sub-templates<\/h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">Let's take one thing at a time and start with the use of&nbsp;<strong>sub-templates<\/strong>&nbsp;and how they work.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\"><strong>K2<\/strong>, as most Joomla extensions nowadays, uses the MVC design pattern. This means that you can override (copy) the default content of the tmpl or template folder under the template's folder.&nbsp;In the screenshot below you can see the component's folder structure:<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"image1\" src=\"images\/blog\/k2Inheritance\/image1.png\" height=\"483\" width=\"279\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>All you need to do is copy the contents of the template folder (as shown in the image above) and paste it under <strong>templates\/YOUR_TEMPLATE\/html\/com_k2\/<\/strong> folder. That way you can make any modification on your project without tampering with the component's core files. The 'default' folder is the one that you can theme into variations unlike the files that are not included in this folder, i.e. generic.php, profile.php, register.php, etc.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can create multiple copies of the 'default' folder each one representing a new variation, and you can select each of them through the K2 category parameter or the menu's parameter. One example of that would be if you had one <strong>Blog style page<\/strong> and one <strong>Catalog page<\/strong>. The <strong>Blog page<\/strong> would be a list of articles and the <strong>catalog page<\/strong> would most likely be a grid of products. In this case your blog category should have the 'default' template assigned to it and the catalog category should have the 'catalog' sub-template.<\/p>\r\n<p>You can also decide which elements your sub-templates have in common, whether this is the category (<em>category.php<\/em>), tag (<em>tag.php<\/em>), user (<em>user.php<\/em>) or item page (<em>item.php<\/em>) with the default and include only the different file(s) in your sub-template.<\/p>\r\n<h4>We will explain that better by using an example.<\/h4>\r\n<p>Let's assume that you have a project with two categories, <strong>News<\/strong> and <strong>Blog<\/strong>. You want a different item view for each one of these categories. The page layout is completely different and you have to use a new sub-template. All other page layouts are the same though. How should you approach this?<\/p>\r\n<p>Your first move would be to create the override of the component's default template, following the procedure you already know, and assign it through the <strong>News<\/strong> category parameters. Then you would create another copy of the default template with a different name, let's say <strong>blog<\/strong>, to cover the second case where the <em>item.php<\/em> is different. Now you have to assign this template (blog) to the <strong>Blog<\/strong> category.<br \/><strong><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Your file\/folder structure is as follows:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"image2\" src=\"images\/blog\/k2Inheritance\/image2.png\" height=\"545\" width=\"279\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>So far all is set and you can start modifying to reach the desired result.<br \/>In the process you might ask yourself though<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\"Why do I have to maintain all files in both template folders since the only one that actually changes is the <em>item.php<\/em>? Wouldn't it be better if I could just keep only the different <em>item.php<\/em> in my sub-template and all other common files were fetched through the 'default' template?\"<\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>Fortunately for you, <strong>the&nbsp;K2 team<\/strong> has already thought of that and you can keep in your sub-template folder only the files that contain the modifications represented to the page layouts. All common structured files will be fetched through the 'default' template and the result would be the same without keeping any duplicate files.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Your files\/folder structure would be:<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"image3\" src=\"images\/blog\/k2Inheritance\/image3.png\" height=\"393\" width=\"279\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h2>K2 Inheritance<\/h2>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">In Joomla, to set up your category options and item options specifically by category you would have to add them to every single menu item you create. With <strong>K2<\/strong> you don't have to search and add parameters every time you want to add or change a view (eg. category). These parameters are located in the categories parameters and, in some cases, can be also overridden through the menu item for more flexibility.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>If you already use <strong>K2<\/strong>&nbsp;you might have noticed the category option called <strong>\"Inherit parameter options from category\"<\/strong> in the category's parameters. This option has proven to be very useful since you don't have to set the same parameters to all your categories one by one. Instead, you can set up one category's parameters and assign all others to inherit their parameters from the first one.<\/p>\r\n<p>Let's examine some category structure cases to understand how this works.<\/p>\r\n<h4>Case 1: Category structure with one parent category and children categories.<\/h4>\r\n<p><img alt=\"case1 structure\" src=\"images\/blog\/k2Inheritance\/case1_structure.png\" height=\"367\" width=\"560\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>In this case we have set up our children categories to inherit their parameters from their Parent category, <strong>Blog<\/strong>.<br \/>We will start with the first child category and select from the option <strong>\"Inherit parameter options from category\"<\/strong> their parent, <strong>Blog<\/strong>, as shown below.<\/p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"case1-inherit2\" src=\"images\/blog\/k2Inheritance\/case1-inherit2.png\" height=\"302\" width=\"560\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>You have to do this for every child category that needs to have common parameters. To help you easily refer to each category's inheritance, without having to edit the category itself, you can check the <strong>\"Inherits parameters from\"&nbsp;<\/strong>column. This filter is very useful especially when we have a large number of categories which inherit their parameters from multiple categories.<br \/><span style=\"font: 13px Arial;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"case1-afterInherit\" src=\"images\/blog\/k2Inheritance\/case1-afterInherit.png\" height=\"367\" width=\"560\" \/><\/p>\r\n<h4>Case 2: Category structure with all categories in the same level that share the same parameters.<\/h4>\r\n<p><img alt=\"case2-structure\" src=\"images\/blog\/k2Inheritance\/case2-structure.png\" height=\"333\" width=\"560\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>In this case we will demonstrate a way to use dummy categories (with no items assigned to them) which will be only used for the category setup.<br \/>We have created a category called <strong>\"SETUP Category Blog\"<\/strong>. We will set our categories to inherit their parameters from this category.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/>Let's start from the first category<\/p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"case2-inherit\" src=\"images\/blog\/k2Inheritance\/case2-inherit.png\" height=\"303\" width=\"560\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>and move on to the rest. Our resulting list will be like the following:<\/p>\r\n<p><img alt=\"case2-afterInherit\" src=\"images\/blog\/k2Inheritance\/case2-afterInherit.png\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>You can choose which of these two cases suits your project best and apply them.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\"><\/span><\/p>\r\n<h2><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">K2 Inheritance through the menu&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<p>Another place you can set up category&nbsp;<strong>parameters and inheritances<\/strong>&nbsp;is the <strong>menu item <\/strong>of the<strong> K2 Category<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you create a K2 Category menu item and <strong>select a category<\/strong> through the category selector, you could override <strong>only<\/strong> its <strong>Ordering options<\/strong>.

Gone are the days when you had to choose between a handful of system fonts with sometimes embarrassing results (Yes I\u2019m looking at you Comic Sans) or you had to jump&nbsp;through&nbsp;various&nbsp;hoops to use a non-system font on your website. Thankfully the resources and tools available right now make it easier and safer to make changes to an existing website design or template as long as we bear in mind some common best practices and take advantages of the tools at our disposal. Let\u2019s dive in and examine some of these.<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<h2>All fonts are not created equal<\/h2>\r\n<p>The width and height of each character is usually different across typefaces for the same weight, style and font-size. I know this can be very confusing at first so let\u2019s take a look at an example.<br \/><br \/> In the screenshot below you can see the letters of two different typefaces:&nbsp;Oswald (in blue) and Open Sans (in red) both set with exactly the same font size, line height and weight but different colour and font family.&nbsp;(There is also a&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/codepen.io\/panos-nuevvo\/pen\/wsFmo\">live version<\/a>&nbsp;available if you care to tinker with it on codepen.)<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/blog\/1.png\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Notice something peculiar? None of the letters are actually 120px in height (marked by the two horizontal lines) and there\u2019s a big difference in what 120px means between the font-families themselves too. And this goes for the width of the characters as well. Without getting into too much detail, the reasons for this are mostly related to the way fonts are designed although there might cases where it\u2019s just a matter of a badly designed font.<\/p>\r\n<p>The lesson to be learned here is that choosing a font, or replacing an existing one, should be practiced with caution. Changing a font-family without considering the size, among other things, may affect the&nbsp;readability of your text or may cause unwanted text wrapping. On-line tools like<span style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: normal; font-family: 'PT Serif';\"><\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/tiff.herokuapp.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Tiff<\/a>&nbsp; and&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/typewonder.com\/%20\" target=\"_blank\">Typewonder<\/a>&nbsp;can help you spot these differences in size so that you can make sure you\u2019re picking the right typeface for the job or determine the adjustments you need to make.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Counting the font-family&nbsp;\u2026members.<\/h2>\r\n<p>Now that there\u2019s an abundance of web fonts on-line, one important thing to note is that not all font families available have the same amount of widths and styles. Google Web fonts hosts hundreds of font families some of which have up to 12 different styles like Christian Robertsons\u2019s&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/fonts\/specimen\/Roboto\">Roboto<\/a>, whereas others, like Julieta Ulanovsky\u2019s beautiful&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.google.com\/fonts\/specimen\/Montserrat\">Montserrat<\/a>&nbsp;has only two styles available: &nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\"><img src=\"images\/blog\/2.png\" alt=\"2\" \/><\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">This doesn\u2019t mean that one font-family is better than the other but if you\u2019re planning to use a web font with long body of text, it is generally preferable to pick a font with many styles available to ensure the formatting of the text such as bolding and italicising will be rendered correctly. If, on the other hand, you\u2019re looking for a font family to replace an existing one you need to make sure the font&nbsp;family you choose has matching styles.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\"><\/span>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Font rendering issues<\/h2>\r\n<p>Another crucial difference among fonts is the way they are rendered on screen. This means that the font you choose might look different to the&nbsp;visitors of your website depending on the browser and the operating system they might be using. In most cases the differences for a given font family can be minor and noticeable only on smaller text sizes but&nbsp;there are&nbsp;cases where it can seriously affect the legibility of your text.<\/p>\r\n<p>Making a font look good across a wide range of systems, also known as \u2018<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Font_hinting\" target=\"_blank\">font hinting<\/a>\u2019 is&nbsp;a lot&nbsp;harder than it sounds and requires a&nbsp;substantial amount of work on the font designer\u2019s behalf.<br \/><br \/> Some font services like&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/www.typekit.com\" target=\"_blank\">Typekit<\/a>&nbsp;offer previews of each font style available across a number of systems and browsers to save you from the trouble of having to check them all by yourself. For the rest of the fonts it\u2019s up to you to do the testing though.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/blog\/3.png\" alt=\"3\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Setting your typography on the browser.<\/h2>\r\n<p>It's a common secret that the best way to test all&nbsp;of the&nbsp;above and make sure you\u2019ve made the right&nbsp;adjustments, is to do the testing right in the browser, but this is can be tedious since it might require a lot of code&nbsp;writing and browser reloading.<br \/><br \/> Fortunately, on-line tools such as <a href=\"http:\/\/typecast.com\/preview\/myfonts\">Typecast&nbsp;<\/a>provide a complete design environment that lets you experiment with thousands of fonts and practically every&nbsp;aspect of typographic design.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/blog\/4.png\" alt=\"4\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p><br \/><strong>EXTRA TIP:<\/strong> Avoid using 'Lorem Ipsum\u2019 text when designing text as it can often be misleading since it prevents you from reading the&nbsp;actual text you are typesetting. For optimum results, use an excerpt of readable text&nbsp;written on the target language of your website.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Beyond Google Web fonts.<\/h2>\r\n<p>Tired of using the&nbsp;same ol' fonts from the Google Web Fonts directory?&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">There are plenty of&nbsp;resources online resources such as&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"http:\/\/www.fontsquirrel.com\/\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">Font Squirrel<\/span><\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">&nbsp;and the recently updated&nbsp;<\/span><a href=\"https:\/\/edgewebfonts.adobe.com\/fonts\"><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">Edge Web Fonts<\/span><\/a><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">&nbsp;service from Adobe that provides even more great choices and alternatives.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">In fact Adobe\u2019s Edge font service uses Typekit\u2019s excellent interface for discovering and filtering the available web fonts, a feature that\u2019s sorely missing from Google\u2019s Web Fonts service.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/blog\/5.png\" alt=\"5\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Typekit easter eggs<\/h3>\r\n<p>Speaking of Typekit and Adobe, I\u2019ve recently discovered that a&nbsp;handful of typefaces available on Typekit\u2019s service support even more languages than it is officially stated on their website.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"font-size: 16px; line-height: normal; font-family: 'PT Serif';\"> <\/span>Beautifully&nbsp;designed fonts like FF Din, FF Meta and Myria Pro provide support for extra languages such as Greek or Vietnamese.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Typography beyond text<\/h2>\r\n<p>In case you\u2019ve missed it, webfonts are widely&nbsp;being used as a way to display various icons on websites as well. There are many advantages using this method since webfonts use vectors instead of bitmaps to display each icon.&nbsp;This makes such webfonts (also called iconfonts) very lightweight and flexible since they behave as text which is both easily scalable and stylable&nbsp;using plain CSS.&nbsp;Services like<a href=\"http:\/\/icomoon.io\/\">&nbsp;IcoMoon<\/a>&nbsp;enable you to create your own custom icon font using icons from other icon fonts or your own custom vectors in SVG format.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/blog\/6.png\" alt=\"6\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Look under the hood for inspiration<\/h2>\r\n<p>If you\u2019re stuck trying to find a good webfont or webfont combination for your site, you can always seek out for typographic inspiration around the web. A great starting point would be sites that catalog examples of great typography&nbsp;online such as<strong>&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/typ.io\">Typ.io<\/a><\/strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong><a href=\"http:\/\/fontsinuse.com\/\">Fonts in use<\/a>.<\/strong><br \/><br \/> The easiest way to find out what typefaces are being used by a website is to use&nbsp;<a href=\"http:\/\/chengyinliu.com\/whatfont.html\">WhatFont<\/a>&nbsp;a browser extension\/plug-in that lets you click on any selectable type to reveal all kinds of information related to the typography of each block.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/blog\/what-font.png\" alt=\"what-font\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>System fonts are not that safe anymore.<\/h2>\r\n<p>There are cases where you might want to use a system font, a font that\u2019s available already on the system of your visitors systems, either because you like it better or you have to, because using an external font service is not an option.&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> Contrary to what you might think, this is not as easy as it used to be. The explosion of smartphone and tablet usage has increased the amount of different devices and operating systems that can potentially access your website and each one of them might have a different set of system fonts.<br \/> <br \/> In those special cases it\u2019s good to have an updated reference&nbsp;such as <a href=\"http:\/\/iosfonts.com\" target=\"_blank\">iOSFonts<\/a> and <a href=\"http:\/\/www.jordanm.co.uk\/tinytype\" target=\"_blank\">TinyType<\/a>&nbsp;that catalog all the system fonts available on popular systems, and a well crafted fallback list of fonts.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Testing your responsive typography<\/h2>\r\n<p>The advent of responsive design, among other things, bade farewell to the illusion of fixed width viewports and the handfull of screen resolutions and systems you had to consider. Nowadays it's all about fluid containers, high resolution screens and cross-media legibility. Adjusting your web typography to look great under all those unpredictable circumstances may seem impossible at first but fear not, there are plenty of methodologies you can apply especially if you write your CSS using SASS but not all of them are easy to apply.&nbsp;<br \/> <br \/> Before delving into media queries and SASS mixins, especially for those new to typography on the web, I would recommend experimenting with <a href=\"http:\/\/simplefocus.com\/flowtype\/\" target=\"_blank\"><\/a><a href=\"http:\/\/simplefocus.com\/flowtype\/\" target=\"_blank\">Flowtype<\/a>.js&nbsp;by Simple Focus. Flowtype.js uses javacript to adjust the font size and line height of your text according to the width of a specific container by setting up a few parameters. Although Flowtype.js does not offer the fine-grained control over your typography, a larger and more complex project may require, it does work quite well and it can definitely become a useful prototyping tool to determine the manual adjustments and optimizations you need to make.<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/blog\/flowtypejs.png\" alt=\"flowtypejs\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>And that\u2019s a wrap!<\/h2>\r\n<p>The recent advances on the web have marked a new powerful era for on-line typography and I believe we are still scratching the surface of what can be achieved. But, as always, great power comes with great responsibility and so following some of the best practices and making right use of the available tools and methodologies can help us avoid serious mistakes and dangers that might be hiding around the corner. &nbsp;Be sure to come back as we\u2019ll be posting in-depth articles about some of the topics we covered in this post, along with tutorials and walkthroughs for you to explore and experiment with.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>","extra_fields":null,"created":"2013-11-14 22:00:00","created_by_alias":"Panos","modified":"2015-01-28 16:22:56","featured":"0","image":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/ffe144b59c409587b4c9211fb31afdfe_XS.jpg?t=1422462176","imageWidth":"100","image_caption":"","image_credits":"","imageXSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/ffe144b59c409587b4c9211fb31afdfe_XS.jpg?t=1422462176","imageSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/ffe144b59c409587b4c9211fb31afdfe_S.jpg?t=1422462176","imageMedium":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/ffe144b59c409587b4c9211fb31afdfe_M.jpg?t=1422462176","imageLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/ffe144b59c409587b4c9211fb31afdfe_L.jpg?t=1422462176","imageXLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/ffe144b59c409587b4c9211fb31afdfe_XL.jpg?t=1422462176","video":null,"video_caption":"","video_credits":"","gallery":null,"hits":"30130","category":{"id":"1","name":"Blog","alias":"blog","link":"\/blog","description":"","image":"","ordering":"1"},"tags":[],"attachments":[],"votingPercentage":0,"numOfvotes":"(0 votes)","author":{"name":"Panos","link":"http:\/\/www.joomlaworks.net\/","avatar":"\/components\/com_k2\/images\/placeholder\/user.png","profile":{"gender":null}},"numOfComments":"1","events":{"BeforeDisplay":"","AfterDisplay":"","AfterDisplayTitle":"","BeforeDisplayContent":"","AfterDisplayContent":"","K2BeforeDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplayTitle":"","K2BeforeDisplayContent":"","K2AfterDisplayContent":"","K2CommentsCounter":""},"language":"*"},{"id":"193","title":"Responsive navigation in Joomla","alias":"responsive-navigation-in-joomla","link":"\/blog\/item\/193-responsive-navigation-in-joomla","catid":"1","introtext":"<p>This week in our series of web design and development blog posts we are going to dive deep into responsive Joomla templating and demonstrate part of our daily template development workflow here at JoomlaWorks HQ.<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<p>Responsive navigation has been covered in lots of tutorials across the web. But let's face it, Joomla has it's (modular) way of things. For one, you know that the Joomla menu has a default HTML output using an unordered list (ul), which is pretty generic. If you've done Joomla template overrides before, you know that the process of overriding the HTML output of any extension may be simple, but there's a small catch for the menu module specifically. Since the output of the menu module is heavily mixing HTML with PHP code (due to the nature of the code, to be honest), if you perform changes to the HTML output, you may be put in a position to contantly monitor if your override works whenever a new Joomla update is released. Not that it's happened too often, but it has happened...<\/p>\r\n<p>How cool would it be if we could leave the HTML output of the menu module untouched and \"responsive-ize\" our menu using just a few lines of JavaScript\/jQuery and CSS? As you'll see in the code snippets following, we're not touching the menu module overrides at all. We'll be extending our existing menu by creating a \"classic\" responsive menu that is vertical and gets triggered by an anchor link when our site is viewed on a mobile or tablet device. So our menu will switch from a typical horizontal menu to a vertical one.<\/p>\r\n<p>We'll be doing things in 3 steps: first place the required HTML and JavaScript, then add the CSS for the responsive state and thirdly, extend the CSS to animate the menu when toggled on and off.<\/p>\r\n<p>The code examples will work on most tablet and mobile devices. We'll assume that the desktop layout is already handled by your template.<\/p>\r\n<p>Beside the static code examples, we'll be using live code examples embedded from jsFiddle.<\/p>\r\n<p>So let's get started!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Step 1a: Some Basic Markup<\/h3>\r\n<p>The markup is pretty straightforward. Open up the index.php file of your Joomla template and locate the module position in which we're publishing our main (multi level) menu. Let's say this module position is called \"main_menu\". We'll be wrapping the module position with a &lt;nav&gt; element (part of the HTML5 spec), but you can use any other block element (e.g. a &lt;div&gt;). Inside the &lt;nav&gt; element we're adding an anchor link with a hash (#) for the URL. This anchor element will be used as the menu toggler when our site is rendered in a tablet or mobile device. On desktop browsers our menu will look as it did before implementing this (unobtrusive) technique :)<\/p>\r\n<p>Here's the code to add in our index.php file:<\/p>\r\n<pre>&lt;?php if($this-&gt;countModules('main_menu')): ?&gt;\r\n&lt;nav id=\"siteNav\"&gt;\r\n  &lt;a href=\"#\" id=\"menuToggler\" class=\"show-on-small\"&gt;&amp;#9776; Menu&lt;\/a&gt;<br \/>  &lt;jdoc:include type=\"modules\" name=\"main_menu\" style=\"\" \/&gt;\r\n&lt;\/nav&gt;\r\n&lt;?php endif ;?&gt;    \r\n<\/pre>\r\n<p>As you'll notice, the <strong>&lt;nav&gt;&nbsp;<\/strong>element has an id attribute of \"menuToggler\". This is going to be used by our small jQuery snippet to attach the necessary open\/close (toggle) behaviour when clicking the anchor element. The anchor element encloses the so called \"navicon\" or \"hamburger icon\" (\u2630) that we all know and use in many popular apps in tablet and mobile devices.<\/p>\r\n<p>When on a tablet or mobile device, we're gonna be hiding the entire menu <em>but<\/em> the anchor, then use the anchor as the toggler (when clicked) to show\/hide the menu. We do this by adding \"a#menutoggler {display:none;}\" in our template's CSS file. And we're adding some basic CSS to lay out the menu for this demo. On a real live site, this will already be handled by your template.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Step 1b: A simple jQuery script<\/h3>\r\n<p>Instead of using complex JavaScript based animation to toggle our responsive menu, we're going to use CSS transitions and transforms. They are easier to implement and will render better now and in the future. So, we'll only be adding JavaScript for the toggler functionality in the anchor link. This snippet swaps \"visibility\" classes on the menu container.<\/p>\r\n<p>This is the code:<\/p>\r\n<pre>&lt;script type=\"text\/javascript\"&gt;<br \/>(function($){\r\n    $(document).ready(function(){   \r\n        $('#menuToggler').on('click', function(e){\r\n            e.preventDefault;\r\n            $('#siteNav ul.menu').toggleClass('menuIsActive');\r\n        });\r\n    });\r\n})(jQuery);<br \/>&lt;\/script&gt;\r\n<\/pre>\r\n<p>Nothing fancy or complicated here. Just simple class toggling. The a element with the id #menuToggler simply changes the class of your &lt;ul&gt; menu. Notice that the menu module's output already includes the class \".menu\", so we're using this class to target our entire menu list from top to bottom. The visibility and all the effects will later be handled by CSS.<\/p>\r\n<p>If you're not already loading jQuery on your site, check your template settings for a related option. Almost all templates nowadays load jQuery by default. Otherwise look for a plugin to load jQuery on your site or simply add jQuery directly in your template's &lt;head&gt; tag.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" src=\"http:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/kricore\/ETZjd\/embedded\/\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Step 2: The CSS code<\/h3>\r\n<p>We've covered the \"desktop\" state so far. Essentially what we've added is still not visible to anyone. We'll move on now and add the required CSS media queries to control the visibility of our menu on tablet and mobile devices. We'll assume the screen limit for such devices starts at a maximum of 800px. The code example that follows will make the anchor link visible when we switch to a screen that is 800px wide or less, while hiding the desktop menu and changing its orientation to vertical at the same time.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" src=\"http:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/kricore\/4RLDH\/embedded\/\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><em>(From my experience I have noticed that building my menu module code based on the '&gt;' <strong>child combinator<\/strong> requires significantly <strong>less code and fewer overrides<\/strong>, meaning cleaner and more sustainable code)<\/em><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/blog\/css-specificity.jpg\" alt=\"\" title=\"http:\/\/cssspecificity.com\/ - CSS Specificity Illustrations\" class=\"caption\" \/><small><a href=\"http:\/\/cssspecificity.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">CSS Specificity<\/a> with icons inspired by \"The Shining\"<\/small><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>I'm styling each level distinctly so when I have to \"decorate\" multi level menus I don't have to reset paddings, borders, radiuses, shadows (you get the picture...) on every level. Is it over specified? Sure.. but the code is much cleaner.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Step 3: Putting the menu off-canvas &amp; animating things<\/h3>\r\n<p>Now that we have our basic working example of our responsive menu, we'll move on and spice it up a bit. We'll push the vertical menu \"off-canvas\" in its \"off\" state and the toggler will display back the menu using a linear slide-in effect from the left. Notice the CSS code blocks added that control the transition &amp; transforms.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><iframe width=\"100%\" height=\"300\" src=\"http:\/\/jsfiddle.net\/kricore\/KVH4F\/embedded\/\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"><\/iframe><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>And there you have it!<\/p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img src=\"images\/blog\/end-result.png\" alt=\"\" title=\"The End Result\" class=\"caption\" width=\"308\" \/><br \/><small>The End Result<\/small><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h2>Moving forward: tips, techniques &amp; a faster workflow<\/h2>\r\n<h3>A note on media queries &amp; breakpoints<\/h3>\r\n<p>In this demo we have a breakpoint at 800px.

In fact it's so ubiquitous that it almost feels like there's some new rule stuck above every designer's monitor, fearfully stipulating something like: \"Thou shall design everything to be as flat as possible\". Let's look into some of the misunderstandings about flat design and how we can benefit from it.<\/p>\r\n","fulltext":"\r\n<h2><span>&nbsp;<\/span><\/h2>\r\n<h3><span>Graphical User Evolution<\/span><\/h3>\r\n<p>Everything started as a problem in XEROX Parc labs in the 70s. A bunch of scientists were experimenting with new ways to make interaction with computers a lot easier than it was back then. It was a time when those rare-to-come-by, bulky, difficult to understand and use machines operated by typing cryptic commands on a clicky keyboard while staring on a black monitor with a blinking dot.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>So they came up with the concept of the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.webopedia.com\/TERM\/G\/Graphical_User_Interface_GUI.html\">Graphical User Interface<\/a>&nbsp;or GUI. In simple terms, a GUI consists of a pointer, a pointing device, icons, a desktop, some windows and menus. Sounds familiar? I bet it does. It was a brilliant design concept that changed forever the way we interact with computers. But why is that?<\/p>\r\n<p>Without getting into much detail, it's basically because GUIs use metaphors from the physical 3D world we live in. Every command became a series of clicks and drags with the mouse, on little images called icons that represented objects we are already familiar with. If you wanted to erase a file from your hard disk, instead of typing the command 'delete', all you had to do is click on an icon that represents that file and then drag it on another icon that resembles a trash can. It suddenly got so much simpler.<\/p>\r\n<p>Here's a video of Bill Atkinson at Apple, demoing one of the first GUIs that were later adopted and refined by Apple.<\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: 'PT Sans', sans-serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 18px;\">{youtube}NxEmJu8OSug|560|450{\/youtube}&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Because we can ...not because we have to.<\/h3>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>Good Design Makes A Product Understandable:&nbsp;It clarifies the product's structure. Better still, it can make the product clearly express its function by making use of the user\u2019s intuition. At best, it is self-explanatory.<br \/><strong><small>Dieter Rams, \"Ten Principles of Good Design\"<\/small><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">So for the past four decades, designers had to use all sorts of realism as metaphors for the physical world, such as artificial light to create shadows and 3D buttons that looked 'clickable', textures, animation and sound effects in order to familiarise the user with the GUI. In many cases the entire interface would look and behave like a real life object or device like a bookcase for an application that stores and displays e-books, a tape cassette recorder for an app that plays podcasts or a calculator that has the same layout as the ones we use in the physical world. These are types of devices that we have come to know as \"<a href=\"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Skeuomorph\" target=\"_blank\">skeumorphic<\/a>\".&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">It's also worth noting that although most skeumorphic interfaces tend to look realistic, skeumorphism and realism don't always go hand in hand. There are plenty examples of \"flat\" interfaces that make use of skeumorphic design. One of the most characteristic ones are the calculator apps we use on our smartphones. As you can see in the image below, the latest version of the calulator on iOS 7 doesn't use any realistic elements but retains the layout of the buttons found on stand-alone calculators.<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/blog\/55.jpg\" alt=\"55\" width=\"556\" height=\"298\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\">Fast forward to the present, when computing devices and interfaces have become so ubiquitus that for the first time in interactive design history we don't have to use realism and skeumorphism to \"educate\" the user about the basics. We can safely assume that in most cases he or she can easily determine the functionality of the basic elements of an interface such as a button, or a menu without the connections to the physical world.&nbsp;<\/span><\/p>\r\n<p><span style=\"line-height: 1.3em;\"><\/span>Although we talk about it for the past couple of years, flat design interfaces have existed long before that, but the difference is that now we can safely assume that it is<strong> understandable for the average user<\/strong>.&nbsp;And this is truly liberating because it gives us the opportunity to create even more engaging and intuitive interfaces without making the compromises we did a few decades ago, for the sake of familiarity. After all, good design is all about making the right compromises to solve a set of well defined problems.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<h3>Flat design as a set of choices, not as panacea.<\/h3>\r\n<p>So does this mean that \"flat design\" is the only way to go &amp; using any kind of realistic\/skeumorphic elements is wrong? Of course not. Each decision to remove a realistic or skeumorphic element should be based on how well the end result serves the purpose of the speficic design. For instance, for the reasons that we discussed above, skeumorphism and realism tend to result in designs that are easier to understand and operate by novice users. So before going \"flat\", it should be clear whether the end result might have an impact on usability. In addition, good use of certain realistic and skeumorphic elements has the power to recall the memories of interacting with actual physical objects or devices themeselves. This is a great way to evoke the right emotions to achieve the desired user experience. It has been proved that pleasant experiences improve brain functionality for problem solving, which in turn means that by creating a beautiful and pleasant to use product your users will have better chances of figuring out how it works:<\/p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>In a clever set of experiments, Alice Isen has shown that if people are given small, unexpected gifts, afterwards they are able to solve problems that require creative thought better than people who were not given gifts. The positive affective system seems to change the cognitive parameters of problem solving to emphasize breadth-first thinking, and the examination of multiple alternatives.<br \/><strong><small>Norman, D. A. (2002). Emotion and design: Attractive things work better.&nbsp;<em>Interactions Magazine<\/em>,<em>&nbsp;ix<\/em>&nbsp;(4), 36-42.<\/small><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<\/blockquote>\r\n<p>Let's take a look at an example. Below is a screenshot from the <a href=\"http:\/\/www.athenos.com\" target=\"_blank\">website of Athenos<\/a>:<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"images\/blog\/athenos.jpg\" alt=\"athenos\" width=\"560\" height=\"564\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Athenos.com is an awarding winning website, and a pretty good example of how flat design aesthetics and choices can be combined with realistic and skeumorphic elements. All the buttons and navigation elements on the site appear as simple and flat white or green rectangular areas which, by today's standards, are very easy to interpret as clickable.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>However the rest of the website is filled with all sorts for textures and shadows in order to evoke certain emotions and memories related to the kitchen and the traditional greek cuisine such as wood, marble, linen and paper all combined with images of objects that appear to be overlaid on top of these surfaces using shadows. The end result is a website that uses flat design and realistic elements on the right places to create a fun and memorable experience.<\/p>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;<\/h2>\r\n<h3>Flat design as a way to future proof your design<\/h3>\r\n<p>Another, more practical, aspect of \"flat design\" is the way that this approach has the potential to produce websites and applications that can be experienced in multiple devices without looking terrible or oversimplified.&nbsp;In fact, more and more devices are capable of accessing the web so it's practically impossible to predict what combination of hardware and software might be used to access any given website or application. It is evident that a future-proof design has to be as device agnostic as possible.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Flat design has certain characteristics that happen to be excellent candidates for device agnostic design, such as the tendency to use simplified forms, ample white space, grids, typography and icons (instead of bitmaps). If you add on top of this the use of SVG vector elements (which are <a href=\"http:\/\/caniuse.com\/#search=svg\" target=\"_blank\">widely supported<\/a> and best of all infinitely scalable), you can rest assured your design will appear clear and crisp on every device that supports all these features for many years to come.<\/p>\r\n<h2>&nbsp;<\/h2>\r\n<h3>Onwards<\/h3>\r\n<p>Flat design is first and foremost an indication that we have made an important evolutionary step in the way we interact with interfaces, especially in websites and mobile applications. Therefore, flat design should be regarded as a set of choices we have the freedom to make, as part of any design process, while being careful before discarding any of the realistic (skeumorphic) elements that might initially seem outdated and unneccessary. Last but not least, flat design lays the foundations to \"future-proof\" your next website or application for any type of device.<\/p>","extra_fields":null,"created":"2013-10-16 21:00:00","created_by_alias":"Panos","modified":"2015-01-28 16:24:15","featured":"0","image":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/c6db11a71571f6269d8aa754fc40212f_XS.jpg?t=1422462255","imageWidth":"100","image_caption":"","image_credits":"","imageXSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/c6db11a71571f6269d8aa754fc40212f_XS.jpg?t=1422462255","imageSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/c6db11a71571f6269d8aa754fc40212f_S.jpg?t=1422462255","imageMedium":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/c6db11a71571f6269d8aa754fc40212f_M.jpg?t=1422462255","imageLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/c6db11a71571f6269d8aa754fc40212f_L.jpg?t=1422462255","imageXLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/c6db11a71571f6269d8aa754fc40212f_XL.jpg?t=1422462255","video":null,"video_caption":"","video_credits":"","gallery":null,"hits":"18340","category":{"id":"1","name":"Blog","alias":"blog","link":"\/blog","description":"","image":"","ordering":"1"},"tags":[],"attachments":[],"votingPercentage":0,"numOfvotes":"(0 votes)","author":{"name":"Panos","link":"http:\/\/www.joomlaworks.net\/","avatar":"\/components\/com_k2\/images\/placeholder\/user.png","profile":{"gender":null}},"numOfComments":"0","events":{"BeforeDisplay":"","AfterDisplay":"","AfterDisplayTitle":"","BeforeDisplayContent":"","AfterDisplayContent":"","K2BeforeDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplayTitle":"","K2BeforeDisplayContent":"","K2AfterDisplayContent":"","K2CommentsCounter":""},"language":"*"},{"id":"186","title":"Simple Image Gallery Pro version 3 and a new design approach for our components","alias":"simple-image-gallery-pro-version-3-and-a-new-design-approach-for-our-components","link":"\/blog\/item\/186-simple-image-gallery-pro-version-3-and-a-new-design-approach-for-our-components","catid":"1","introtext":"2013 is bringing a lot of new cool things from the JoomlaWorks labs. New extensions that we hope will redefine essential functionality within any Joomla site and lots of updates to our existing line of extensions, like K2, Frontpage Slideshow and Simple Image Gallery Pro. The latter will now become a \"component based\" extension (from just a plugin) to allow content managers to easily create and edit image galleries and their captions for K2 and any other extension within Joomla.<br \/><br \/>We've always put user friendlyness and ease of use above all when building our extensions. At least up to what's possible for any type of extension.&nbsp; Simple Image Gallery Pro was great (and still is) as a plugin that allows you to zip a bunch of files and quickly transform them to an image gallery grid. It's no wonder why the free version is one of the most popular extensions in the Joomla Extensions Directory for many years now. People hate to use tools that take more time to deal with than the actual content they're producing. If it takes you more time to upload a gallery than shooting the actual pictures, then there's a problem. And unfortunately, many gallery components in the Joomlasphere simply fail to deliver what they promise.<br \/>","fulltext":"In the upcoming version 3 of Simple Image Gallery Pro (due out in a few weeks) we aim to redefine \"simplicity\" once more, but this time offering a lot more control. People want to be able to just drag and drop a bunch of images to their browser (instead of zipping them), quickly add some captions (labels) and publish their gallery into a K2 item, Joomla article, Virtuemart\/redShop product or other extension. And that's what the new Simple Image Gallery Pro delivers, while still maintaining full manual control over your galleries via FTP. Sounds great? Well... it is!<br \/><br \/>What you'll also notice in the screenshots below is that Simple Image Gallery Pro's backend is very different from traditional Joomla component backend design. That's because with the launch of Simple Image Gallery Pro version 3, we're also launching our new design approach for our components. More usable, faster to work with, more productive. It's true that Joomla's backend design hasn't really evolved much, even with the launch of Joomla 3. And building components that work on Joomla 2.5, 3.0 and future versions or even older ones like 1.5, means you end up with products that look a lot different. This is bad in many aspects, but it's also becoming boring for us and our customers to use. Yes, Joomla is a bit boring in terms of user interface and it's definitely not the best in terms of user friendlyness. We aim to change that.<br \/><br \/>As you'll notice in the screenshots below, we simply *don't* want the user (newbie or experienced) to think too much before using any of our components. We want the user to sense a \"user interface familiarity\" and start working in a matter of seconds. We also don't want to have dull\/boring designs anymore. We work with Joomla daily and the tools we use should be functionaly and aesthetically pleasing. People managing some of the biggest Joomla websites in the world usually work on K2 for 8 or more staight hours a day. Can we make K2 more functional and more pleasing to the eye, so the whole process of actual \"content management\" becomes more enjoyable?<br \/><br \/>Of course we can. We just have to divert a bit from the current \"Joomla UI guidelines\".<br \/><br \/>For starters, we don't need to show the user buttons that they simply cannot click without first selecting at least 1 item in a classic row of data. Why should we always show the \"move\" button (e.g. for K2 items) when a user would only need to see this button if he clicked one or more items? Likewise, we can organize filters that have 2 possible values only (e.g. sort a list by date created ascending\/descending) altogether, saving lots of space for the content the user sees and manages. As you may have noticed already, device screens are shrinking, instead of growing. Tablets are now selling more than PCs. So by providing more \"real estate\" for our content, we make managing that content a lot easier.<br \/><br \/>Our components' new backend design will be responsive by default, even on Joomla 2.5's backend which is not responsive...<br \/><br \/>Additionally, we've re-thought elements like the component's menu. Does it really have to divide each backend view controls for the actual content? See how browsers changed the placement of their tabs (above everything).<br \/><br \/>We'll provide more insight for our new design approach as we release updates and new extensions throughout the year.<br \/><br \/>","extra_fields":null,"created":"2013-03-07 17:12:38","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-03-07

- a new Joomla extension for better social reach &amp; user engagement","alias":"socialconnect-a-new-joomla-extension-for-better-social-reach-user-engagement","link":"\/blog\/item\/185-socialconnect-a-new-joomla-extension-for-better-social-reach-user-engagement","catid":"1","introtext":"A few days ago we launched SocialConnect, a new kind of social extension for Joomla which we plan to extend over time to become the no. 1 integration hub for social networks for your Joomla site.<br \/><br \/>It's part of our \"masterplan\" to redefine what we consider basic functionality for any Joomla site. It started with K2 and now it's moving deeper into more specialized areas. SocialConnect is an extension that -as with all things made by JoomlaWorks- came out from a real need. And it was tested extensively for more than a year on the K2 Community, before being publicly released.<br \/>","fulltext":"In this first version of SocialConnect we wanted to redefine the entire user engagement process.<br \/><br \/>Let's face it, the user login\/logout process in Joomla is problematic. It's not problematic in the sense that it doesn't work. It's problematic for a \"user experience\" aspect. These user forms are the ones that always require the most \"inventiveness\" from the web designer. You can have a website that spans across 1000 or more pixels and yet your user login page, a page which should give incentives or explain a couple of things to your potentials users on why they should join your eshop or forum or whatever community is just 2 input fields and a submit button in the middle of the page.<br \/><br \/>We believe this can be improved in 4 ways: a) Allow the site administrator to display brief notes on why someone should join their site and what benefits they get (if any), b) provide clear options to login or sign-up, c) allow a visitor to use their favorite social network to instantly login and become a member of your site without the need to remember one more set of login credentials and d) give your user a dashboard, a starting point for your site's activities or services.<br \/><br \/>These may seem trivial to some, but various UI\/UX studies and reports have shown that many websites lose members\/customers on \"hello\". By combining common sense with a clear\/minimal and easy to adapt on any template user login\/logout\/dashboard layout, we hit 4 birds with 1 stone. And to make it even easier for web designers, we already provide 3 different layouts for your login page and 2 for your user module. These layouts are built to be generic so in 95% of websites, you probably won't even have to adapt the CSS overrides of the extension.<br \/>\r\n<div><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" alt=\"SC Dashboard 600x510\" src=\"images\/blog\/SC_Dashboard_600x510.jpg\" height=\"425\" width=\"500\" \/><\/div>\r\nIn version 1.0.0 of SocialConnect we also integrated social login for the top networks worldwide: Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google (and therefore Google+) and Ning. If you haven't heard of <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"http:\/\/www.ning.com\">Ning<\/a>, that because it's a \"white-label\" Facebook. You can't tell a community runs on Ning unless you view the community's HTML source code. But Ning currently powers hundreds of thousands of communities worldwide and it's provided as a cheap hosted service for what it offers. If you never opted for a self-hosted solution for your community or forum for various reasons (from spam to server performance and so on), Ning is a great platform to build your community on. And with SocialConnect you can easily authenticate your Ning community's users to your site.<br \/><br \/>In order to integrate these social capabilities to your Joomla site via SocialConnect, all you need to do is create an \"app\" on each social network that is actually your site. That way you get the required authentication keys which you then enter into SocialConnect's component parameters. You don't need to activate all social login options. But the more you provide, the more you open your site to potential users from these social networks. For details on setting up each network, just download the PDF document we prepared for SocialConnect on our documentation section.<br \/><br \/>Any Joomla site that uses SocialConnect can now allow its users to log in using some of these popular social networks. Wouldn't it be great to also see who's logging in and from which social network? This is where the SocialConnect backend module comes in. It not only provides you with detailed login details per network (and Joomla) but it also provides true \"working\" counters on the maximun number of people browsing your site at the time. So you not only get to see who's logged in and from where, but you also get a complete view of how busy your site is at a given moment.<br \/><br \/>\r\n<h3>So what's next?<\/h3>\r\nThe initial response was very overwhelming. In fact we sold a lot more licenses than we initially anticipated. Which is a good starting point :)<br \/><br \/>Our plans for the coming updates of SocialConnect expand to more than just a better user engagement. Of course we want to add more social login options (Yahoo!, Github and possibly Wordpress.com) and more 3rd party integrations (one-way login from SMF or phpBB forums - yes, you can forget about weird bridges between your forum software and Joomla). But we also want to provide the integration of various important social widgets, e.g. Disqus &amp; Facebook comments for K2, Joomla articles and other extensions. Twitter feeds which you can actually blend with your design - now that Twitter is killing its public API and moving to closed \"app\" like widgets only. Or \"auto post\" features for K2, Joomla articles and other extensions, so you can share on your social networks a blog post or product when it's created in the Joomla backend (no more RSS to social sharing services). And actual \"user pages\" (much like what K2 does now) but integrated with other Joomla extensions. E.g. a user page with their latest K2 items and Kunena forum posts (we love Kunena as you might have guessed!)...<br \/><br \/>We've already had requests for passing some of the social details we retrieve to other extensions like Kunena (it's already on our to-do list), JomSocial (still evaluating due to recent ownership changes), Community Builder or even e-commerce extensions like Virtuemart and redShop. Or ways to migrate from JFBConnect to SocialConnect. We're evaluating all these requests and we'll keep our users posted as we release new updates for SocialConnect.<br \/><br \/>Our goal is to make SocialConnect the integration hub for \"everything social\". So you don't waste time setting up various online services here and there just to maximize your site's \"social reach\". Just bring everything inside Joomla.","extra_fields":null,"created":"2013-02-19 13:25:47","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2013-02-19 18:59:34","featured":"0","image":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/f7f8c4727a011019fe43a7eaa92bf9a5_XS.jpg?t=1361300374","imageWidth":"100","image_caption":"The SocialConnect backend dashboard","image_credits":"","imageXSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/f7f8c4727a011019fe43a7eaa92bf9a5_XS.jpg?t=1361300374","imageSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/f7f8c4727a011019fe43a7eaa92bf9a5_S.jpg?t=1361300374","imageMedium":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/f7f8c4727a011019fe43a7eaa92bf9a5_M.jpg?t=1361300374","imageLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/f7f8c4727a011019fe43a7eaa92bf9a5_L.jpg?t=1361300374","imageXLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/f7f8c4727a011019fe43a7eaa92bf9a5_XL.jpg?t=1361300374","video":null,"video_caption":"","video_credits":"","gallery":null,"hits":"230670","category":{"id":"1","name":"Blog","alias":"blog","link":"\/blog","description":"","image":"","ordering":"1"},"tags":[{"id":"190","name":"socialconnect","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/socialconnect"},{"id":"191","name":"extensions","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/extensions"},{"id":"192","name":"social","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/social"},{"id":"60","name":"joomla","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/joomla"},{"id":"193","name":"integration","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/integration"},{"id":"194","name":"facebook","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/facebook"},{"id":"195","name":"twitter","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/twitter"}],"attachments":[],"votingPercentage":0,"numOfvotes":"(0 votes)","author":{"name":"Fotis","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/user\/989-fotis","avatar":"\/media\/k2\/users\/1563.png","profile":{"id":"1563","gender":"m","description":"","image":"1563.png","url":"","group":"1"}},"numOfComments":"0","events":{"BeforeDisplay":"","AfterDisplay":"","AfterDisplayTitle":"","BeforeDisplayContent":"","AfterDisplayContent":"","K2BeforeDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplayTitle":"","K2BeforeDisplayContent":"","K2AfterDisplayContent":"","K2CommentsCounter":""},"language":"*"},{"id":"168","title":"Resizing the disk space on Ubuntu Server VMs running on VMware ESXi 5","alias":"resizing-the-disk-space-on-ubuntu-server-vms-running-on-vmware-esxi-5","link":"\/blog\/item\/168-resizing-the-disk-space-on-ubuntu-server-vms-running-on-vmware-esxi-5","catid":"1","introtext":"We generally do both dedicated and VPS hosting for our websites, apps and some premium projects we run for others.\r\n<p>When we choose to have VPS servers (aka virtual machines or VMs for short) instead of dedicated servers, we usually opt for <strong>VMware<\/strong>'s free ESXi 5 and install Ubuntu Server as the OS for the VPSs we create on top of ESXi 5.

Still in the terminal, execute the following:&nbsp;<br \/><br \/>$ hg clone <a href=\"https:\/\/googlefontdirectory.googlecode.com\/hg\/googlefontdirectory\">https:\/\/googlefontdirectory.googlecode.com\/hg\/googlefontdirectory<br \/><\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/googlefontdirectory.googlecode.com\/hg\/googlefontdirectory\"><br \/><\/a>This command will retrieve the entire Google Web Fonts repository (around 2GBs at the time of writing) inside this \"GoogleWebFonts\" folder we previously created. It may take from a few minutes to over an hour to download these files depending on network activity and your internet connection speed.<br \/>&nbsp;<br \/><strong>STEP 4<\/strong><br \/>Now let's grab any font updates and zip everything to a handy, clean of irrelevant files, date-marked zip file. At the terminal app, execute the following:&nbsp;<br \/>$ cd ~\/GoogleWebFonts\/googlefontdirectory<br \/>$ hg pull --update<br \/>$ cd ..<br \/>$ find . -iname *.ttf -print | grep -v \"src\" | zip GoogleWebFonts_$(date +\"%Y%m%d\").zip -@<br \/><br \/>The above process will create a file called e.g. GoogleWebFonts_20120816.zip (if we run this process on Aug 16th 2012). The file generated at the time of writing this tutorial was around 70 MBs.\r\n<p>Now you can just drag and drop the fonts directly to the Mac \"Font Book\" app or to make it dead-simple (and cooler of course) extract this zip files inside your ~\/Library\/Fonts\/ folder using this command (if the produced zip file was GoogleWebFonts_20120816.zip):<\/p>\r\n$ mv ~\/GoogleWebFonts\/GoogleWebFonts_20120816.zip ~\/Library\/Fonts\/<br \/>$ cd ~\/Library\/Fonts\/<br \/>$ unzip GoogleWebFonts_20120816.zip\r\n<p><strong><em>Enjoy!<\/em><\/strong><\/p>","extra_fields":null,"created":"2012-08-16 17:24:00","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2015-04-02 21:31:39","featured":"0","image":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/ce7646a74c54cecf1c05442c71f02147_XS.jpg?t=1428010299","imageWidth":"100","image_caption":"","image_credits":"","imageXSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/ce7646a74c54cecf1c05442c71f02147_XS.jpg?t=1428010299","imageSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/ce7646a74c54cecf1c05442c71f02147_S.jpg?t=1428010299","imageMedium":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/ce7646a74c54cecf1c05442c71f02147_M.jpg?t=1428010299","imageLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/ce7646a74c54cecf1c05442c71f02147_L.jpg?t=1428010299","imageXLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/ce7646a74c54cecf1c05442c71f02147_XL.jpg?t=1428010299","video":null,"video_caption":"","video_credits":"","gallery":null,"hits":"40916","category":{"id":"1","name":"Blog","alias":"blog","link":"\/blog","description":"","image":"","ordering":"1"},"tags":[{"id":"50","name":"fonts","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/fonts"},{"id":"51","name":"Google","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/Google"},{"id":"52","name":"linux","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/linux"},{"id":"53","name":"mac","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/mac"},{"id":"54","name":"mercurial","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/mercurial"},{"id":"55","name":"ssh","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/ssh"},{"id":"46","name":"ubuntu","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/ubuntu"},{"id":"56","name":"web fonts","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/web%20fonts"}],"attachments":[],"votingPercentage":0,"numOfvotes":"(0 votes)","author":{"name":"Fotis","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/user\/989-fotis","avatar":"\/media\/k2\/users\/1563.png","profile":{"id":"1563","gender":"m","description":"","image":"1563.png","url":"","group":"1"}},"numOfComments":"0","events":{"BeforeDisplay":"","AfterDisplay":"","AfterDisplayTitle":"","BeforeDisplayContent":"","AfterDisplayContent":"","K2BeforeDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplayTitle":"","K2BeforeDisplayContent":"","K2AfterDisplayContent":"","K2CommentsCounter":""},"language":"*"},{"id":"166","title":"Joomla forks you may have never heard of","alias":"joomla-forks-you-may-have-never-heard-of","link":"\/blog\/item\/166-joomla-forks-you-may-have-never-heard-of","catid":"1","introtext":"As I was cleaning up my bookmarks today (they've reached around 5MBs!), along with some Joomla gems and memories, I found a list of Joomla forks I kept...\r\n<p>I bet you never know those existed.

To be honest, I didn't know at that point Google Analytics could be extended like that, so I dug deeper to learn more.<\/p>\n<p>If you're not an SEO expert using buzzwords like ROI, SEM, CPR etc., you're probably using GA for browsing page views, visitor count, browser percentages etc. Turns out, GA offers at a \"basic level\" the option to  track unique events on your website, e.g. a click on a link or a file  download. Which makes statistics viewing way more interesting...<\/p>\n<p>","fulltext":"<\/p>\n<p>Consider this simple example: getk2.org has around 20 links that rarely change. I wanted to know how many people download K2 from this particular website (and not some third party source), how many people click on the documentation, how many get the SVN version of K2 and so on...<\/p>\n<p>Having read the manual over at GA help, I came down to some basic event tracking usage with GA on getk2.org. The goal was to see for the first time how users \"behave\" inside getk2.org and not just how many come in. GA event tracking organizes results in this manner: Categories, actions, labels. That translates to specific \"pages\" (or some entire section in your site, e.g. Sports news), things that we anticipate users to do (e.g. click on a link or download a file) and finally, names of the actual links being clicked (e.g. \"K2 main file download\"). If you're not lost, bare with me for a sec...<\/p>\n<p>First off, I only wanted to track the K2 homepage (getk2.org) so I used 1 \"category\" in my events: \"K2 Homepage\"<\/p>\n<p>Secondly, I divided my anticipated \"behaviors\" (the \"actions\" in GA lingo) into just 2: visit (for links) and download (for file downloads).<\/p>\n<p>Thirdly, I labeled all links to be tracked in a way that makes sense to me... So the K2 download button is labelled as \"Stable release\". I don't need to mark it as \"Stable release download\", because I've already assigned to that link the right \"action\" (Download).<\/p>\n<p>So I prepare these \"onclick\" JS events, to add them into my homepage links... well, the most important ones... And I let GA track those event for around 2 monts...<\/p>\n<p>To give you an example of such an event:<\/p>\n<p><\/p><div class=\"data type-html\">\n      <table class=\"lines\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"><tr><td>\n            <pre class=\"line_numbers\"><span rel=\"#L1\" id=\"L1\">1<\/span>\n<\/pre>\n          <\/td>\n          <td width=\"100%\">\n                <div class=\"highlight\"><pre><\/pre><div class=\"line\" id=\"LC1\"><span class=\"nt\">&lt;a<\/span> <span class=\"na\">href=<\/span><span class=\"s\">\"http:\/\/domain.com\/about.html\"<\/span> <span class=\"na\">onClick=<\/span><span class=\"s\">\"_gaq.push(['_trackEvent', 'My homepage', 'Visit', 'About Us']);\"<\/span><span class=\"nt\">&gt;<\/span>About Us<span class=\"nt\">&lt;\/a&gt;<\/span><\/div><\/div>\n          <\/td>\n        <\/tr><\/table><\/div>\n<p>Now I come back to GA and go (on the left sidebar) to Content &gt;&gt; Event Tracking and I can see how my visitors behaved... Well, here's a surprise! I didn't know so many people where downloading the SVN release! Needless to say, the results where very encouraging! I won't go into detail, but it's worth trying this on your own.<\/p>\n<p>If you want a solution that hooks up GA tracking events in Joomla, I can't say I know any specific... If you do, please let everyone know in the comments.<\/p>\n<p>But it should not be difficult to implement these events, e.g. in K2 attachment downloads or in other components... Maybe a plugin could also attach such events using JS automatically onto any link that is a file (e.g. PDF, ODF etc.). Or a combination of JS and Joomla PHP to use e.g. the \"title\" of the link to create the \"label\", the file extension in links to determine the \"action\" and the current page (by Joomla) to assign the \"Category\".<\/p>\n<p>I hope you enjoyed this small introduction into GA tracking events. You can see how to attach these events by examining the source code in: <a href=\"http:\/\/getk2.org\">http:\/\/getk2.org<\/a><\/p>\n","extra_fields":null,"created":"2011-06-03 15:11:00","created_by_alias":"","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","featured":"0","image":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/7acce66d40ec90c2d61987b409cbf850_XS.jpg?t=-62169984000","imageWidth":"100","image_caption":"","image_credits":"","imageXSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/7acce66d40ec90c2d61987b409cbf850_XS.jpg?t=-62169984000","imageSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/7acce66d40ec90c2d61987b409cbf850_S.jpg?t=-62169984000","imageMedium":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/7acce66d40ec90c2d61987b409cbf850_M.jpg?t=-62169984000","imageLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/7acce66d40ec90c2d61987b409cbf850_L.jpg?t=-62169984000","imageXLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/7acce66d40ec90c2d61987b409cbf850_XL.jpg?t=-62169984000","video":null,"video_caption":"","video_credits":"","gallery":null,"hits":"128553","category":{"id":"1","name":"Blog","alias":"blog","link":"\/blog","description":"","image":"","ordering":"1"},"tags":[{"id":"63","name":"event tracking","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/event%20tracking"},{"id":"64","name":"getk2.org","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/getk2.org"},{"id":"65","name":"google analytics","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/google%20analytics"}],"attachments":[],"votingPercentage":0,"numOfvotes":"(0 votes)","author":{"name":"Fotis","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/user\/989-fotis","avatar":"\/media\/k2\/users\/1563.png","profile":{"id":"1563","gender":"m","description":"","image":"1563.png","url":"","group":"1"}},"numOfComments":"4","events":{"BeforeDisplay":"","AfterDisplay":"","AfterDisplayTitle":"","BeforeDisplayContent":"","AfterDisplayContent":"","K2BeforeDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplayTitle":"","K2BeforeDisplayContent":"","K2AfterDisplayContent":"","K2CommentsCounter":""},"language":"*"},{"id":"162","title":"F*ck you, pay me - a must see for professionals in web design","alias":"fck-you-pay-me-a-must-see-for-professionals-i","link":"\/blog\/item\/162-fck-you-pay-me-a-must-see-for-professionals-i","catid":"1","introtext":"\n    <p><iframe src=\"http:\/\/player.vimeo.com\/video\/22053820?portrait=0\" frameborder=\"0\" height=\"270\" width=\"480\"><\/iframe><\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/vimeo.com\/22053820\">2011\/03 Mike Monteiro | F*ck You.

Just 6 months. By July 2011, <a href=\"http:\/\/community.joomla.org\/blogs\/leadership\/1395-the-path-forward-migration-and-the-future.html\" target=\"_blank\">the Joomla team will end development<\/a> and proceed to releasing Joomla v1.7.<p><\/p>This is very disturbing for many big projects like K2, considering all the big changes that 1.6 has introduced in its framework (language files, content elements, classes, functions, ACL etc. etc.) and the unnecessary workload added (see language files going back to Joomla 1.0 days), especially for free extensions like K2, Virtuemart and many more...\n<p>Many developers have expressed doubts about 1.6. Jen Kramer also nailed it in her recent blog post: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.joomla4web.com\/blog\/new-post.html\" target=\"_blank\">Joomla 1.6 and Beyond: Should I upgrade? Should I build my new sites in it? <\/a><\/p>\n<p>So did Andy Miller of RocketTheme fame on: <a href=\"http:\/\/www.rockettheme.com\/blog\/joomla\/988-should-i-upgrade-to-joomla-16\" target=\"_blank\">Should I upgrade to Joomla 1.6?<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Back to the title of this post...<\/p>\n<p>","fulltext":"<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why we're not porting K2 for Joomla 1.6 (<em>just yet<\/em>)...<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>First and foremost... What does 1.6 bring to Joomla <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>end users<\/strong><\/span> aside the new version number? It brings ACL (damn acronyms), nested level categories for core Joomla articles (but just that, don't expect tags, comments or other integrated stuff), sub-template overrides, it's removed the useful Polls component (but the VERY useful Weblinks and Newsfeeds components are still there - please don't laugh)... For real...<\/p>\n<p>Let's see what K2 and Joomla 1.5 have compared to 1.6. Well, it's like a whole new CMS! But there's no ACL, some will say... Ok then, for the 100 people of the 10 million who're gonna download 1.6 in the coming months, and actually make use of the ACL... guys, there's a solution for you in K2 and J1.5. You probably don't need to re-do your entire site (which costs money and time)...<\/p>\n<p>Why? Let's face it... when you give access to your backend, you give it to people you trust, your close partners. Joomla 1.5's ACL is pretty good for that. \"Managers\" for content writers and \"admins\"\/\"super admins\" for a couple of people who control the site. It's worked amazingly well for years now... For 99,999% of people, ACL is not required in the backend if you think about it.<\/p>\n<p>But you'll probably need ACL for the frontend and control who gets to see (or input) what. If you're using K2, it's got you covered already. You provide \"frontend editing access\", which allows people to input\/edit  content in your site with a proper ACL system provided by K2... A \"done  deal\" for many popular Joomla sites like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gazzetta.gr\" target=\"_blank\">Gazzetta.gr<\/a> or even the <a href=\"http:\/\/magazine.joomla.org\" target=\"_blank\">Joomla Magazine<\/a>.<\/p>\n<p>Now that 1.6 is out and to further prove our point on \"practical ACL\", we plan to roll either a new component or a system plugin to allow Joomla 1.5 and K2 users to control even \"content viewing\" in the frontend for guests or registered users. Maybe we'll even work on a cool solution for the backend of Joomla 1.5 as well...<\/p>\n<p>Still not convinced? Here are some questions to consider:<\/p>\n<p>- How many popular extensions are available or will be available for 1.6 until 1.6 development is ceased for 1.7... We see many big ones not even 1.5 native up until now (cough, VM, cough). Support for 1.6 is probably a joke, not cause the extension dev is not capable of the conversion, but because 6 months are a small timeframe for FREE extensions, maintained by people for no compensation in their FREE time.<\/p>\n<p>- How many extensions would practically make use of an ACL system. Most that require ACL already got it built in (see K2 or forum components). You probably don't need ACL for Polls or Weblinks, right?<\/p>\n<p>- Would you invest money in developing a site now based on 1.6 and see it become obsolete by July 2011? If 1.6 changed so much from 1.5, why won't 1.7 do the same?<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>What about supporting Joomla 1.6 in general?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>There's  no doubt for that. We will support Joomla 1.6 for our commercial and  free (smaller) extensions, but it's because they're small and therefore  easy to convert\/maintain. I built the 1.6 version of Simple Image  Gallery v2.0 in just one day...<\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<p><strong>So what next?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We go on with 1.5 for K2. It's <strong>a solid platform to develop websites<\/strong> and with the right combination of extensions, it can drive websites that are visited by millions of people per month, when Drupal or Wordpress would sweat the least (without a massive server cluster that is, haha)...<\/p>\n<p>But there is something really new coming along, something that does redefine many elements for developers, which in turn would benefit end-users. Enter \"Nooku Server\"!<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/blog.nooku.org\/2011\/01\/nooku-server-loses-40-weight\/\" target=\"_blank\">Nooku Server<\/a> is a Joomla 1.5 distribution, slimmed down from legacy code, better caching, packaged with the powerful <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nooku.org\" target=\"_blank\">Nooku framework<\/a>, from <a href=\"http:\/\/johan.janssens.me\/\" target=\"_blank\">the man who already built the Joomla 1.5 framework<\/a>. We see Nooku Server, we see what amazing extensions people have built for Nooku and Joomla 1.5 (see <a href=\"http:\/\/ninjaforge.com\/index.php?option=com_ninjacentral&amp;page=show_package&amp;id=84&amp;Itemid=245\" target=\"_blank\">NinjaBoard<\/a>, <a href=\"http:\/\/www.anahitapolis.com\/\" target=\"_blank\">Anahita<\/a> etc.) and we believe there is a better ecosystem for K2 already available.<\/p>\n<p>We already plan the migration of our SMF forum to Ninjaboard and maybe the new site is powered by Nooku Server by the end of the month. The Nooku Server approach is far more realistic, as a) does not demand any code change to 1.5 extensions and b) offers a powerful framework if you want to extend programming to new levels. And I hear something will be arranged for ACL as well.<\/p>\n<p>Sorry folks, but <strong>unless something significantly changes<\/strong> on how Joomla  perceives the life cycle of a version, we do not plan to port K2 to  Joomla 1.6. It's wasted time for a product which will last 6 months. It will be at least 40 days down the drain for us.<\/p>\n<p>I know it's a tough decision, but websites are not desktops  to release a new major version every 6 months, like Ubuntu does...  Websites take time to build... Proper websites (to which 1.6 features are targetted ;) ) take from 30 to 90 days to build...<\/p>\n<p><em>What's your say?<\/em> ;)<\/p>\n<p>You can <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>leave a comment<\/strong><\/span> or <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>place your vote<\/strong><\/span> in the poll I created regarding K2 and Joomla 1.6 in the K2 Community website: <a href=\"http:\/\/community.getk2.org\/#pollFor16\">http:\/\/community.getk2.org\/#pollFor16<\/a><\/p>\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<h2>UPDATES<\/h2>\n<p>1. There seems to be a \"<a href=\"http:\/\/community.joomla.org\/blogs\/leadership\/1407-why-developers-should-upgrade-sooner-than-later.html\" target=\"_blank\">response<\/a>\" for the Joomla team. Kind of bashes extension devs in my opinion, which is very unfair, especially to other projects who are not even now native to J!1.5 but have a huge user base... K2 is 100% native to Joomla 1.5 and can easily be ported to 1.6 in a relaxed timeframe of a month. Other projects need to re-write everything. Our decision however is based on \"practical\" terms and features, not version numbers.<\/p>\n<p>2. Nooku Server is now available to download and test. It's Joomla 1.5, slimmed down, legacy code out, junk stuff out, includes the powerful Nooku framework, amazingly fast admin backend and a lot more... Since this is a release for testing, the Nooku team allows you to connect to their dev server and download the release via SVN. But to make life easier, I created an automated script that will grab the latest SVN snapshot and create a distribution ready to be installed. Grab Nooku Server 0.7 alpha here: <a href=\"http:\/\/nuevvo.com\/nookuserver\/\">http:\/\/nuevvo.com\/nookuserver\/<\/a><\/p>\n<p>3. I see people divided in 2 groups already.

Keep in mind that&nbsp;<span style=\"line-height: 15.6px;\">APC is compatible with PHP up to version 5.3.x. APCu replaces APC for PHP versions 5.4.x or newer and it's currently under active development.<br \/><br \/><\/span>Since PHP 5.3.x is considered obsolete, I'll cover the steps to have APCu installed on your server. If you run PHP 5.3.x either consider updating to 5.5.x\/5.6.x or follow the steps below making sure you replace any \"apcu\" reference with just \"apc\" (minus the \"u\").<br \/><br \/>","fulltext":"There are many tutorials out there covering how to install APCu from command line (as root user), but none on how to install APCu on a WHM\/cPanel server \" <strong>the easy way<\/strong> \". And it's actually pretty easy provided your server is executing PHP in FastCGI mode (the most optimal setup). Default cPanel installations usually run PHP in suPHP mode, which does not allow APCu to be installed. If you have full control of the server, you can use EasyApache in WHM to \"rebuild\" your system with PHP in FastCGI mode.<br \/><br \/>FastCGI mode is known to be a fast and secure way to run PHP on your server... FastCGI is also preferred compared to mod_php as it allows websites to execute with the user's permissions (like with suPHP) and as some claim, it's also the fastest from all other PHP builds.<br \/><br \/>If you want to re-build your server with FastCGI, you can grab a ready-made profile to upload and use in WHM: <a href=\"http:\/\/engintron.com\/files\/cpanel\/engintron.dtd\">http:\/\/engintron.com\/files\/cpanel\/engintron.dtd<\/a><br \/><br \/>Don't bother trying to install APCu via cPanel's PECL modules installer. It's just broken.<br \/><br \/><strong>Now, assuming you have PHP in FastCGI mode running on your WHM\/cPanel<\/strong> (version 11.48+) based server, here are the steps to install APCu on your server:<br \/><br \/>\r\n<h3>1. Install packages<\/h3>\r\nLogin via SSH as \"root\" user on your cPanel server and execute the following commands:<br \/><br \/>$ yum install make pcre-devel <br \/>$ pecl install channel:\/\/pecl.php.net\/APCu-4.0.10<br \/><br \/>The first line installs some required packages. Year 2014 or later builds of cPanel should have these installed. If you run the command and the packages are already installed, nothing will happen. The second line will retrieve the latest 4.x build of APCu directly from the PECL code repositories which is compatible with (at the time of writing) the PHP versions (5.x) that ship with cPanel. APCu's v5.x is currently compatible with PHP 7.x only so don't install that until cPanel includes this PHP version too.<br \/><br \/>Restart Apache via WHM<br \/><br \/>\r\n<h3>2. Edit php.ini<\/h3>\r\nNow edit the master php.ini file of the server - usually located in \/usr\/local\/lib\/php.ini - to add a couple of configuration options for APCu. Open the file (either with some editor like Coda or via \"nano\" or \"vim\") and append these lines at the very bottom of the php.ini file:<br \/><br \/>[apcu] <br \/>apc.enabled = 1 <br \/>apc.shm_size = 128M<br \/><br \/>The second line will create a memory pool of 128MBs of cache available from the system to APCu. If you have lots of sites that will use APCu for caching, adjust accordingly.<br \/><br \/>Restart Apache via WHM.<br \/><br \/>\r\n<h3>3. Adjust settings for APCu<\/h3>\r\nIf you wish to adjust the APCu values above, you can now do so via \"PHP Configuration Editor\" in WHM, after selecting the \"Advanced Mode\" editing option. These 2 values will be at the very top. APCu has a lot more options but \"apc.shm_size\" is obviously the most critical as it defines the memory pool to hold all cache objects coming from your CMS (Joomla, WordPress etc.).<br \/><br \/>Remember that whenever your edit your PHP's configuration, you need to restart Apache for the changes to take effect.<br \/><br \/>\r\n<h3 style=\"line-height: 15.6px;\">4. Keep in mind<\/h3>\r\nIf you rebuild your cPanel's LAMP stack with EasyApache, you need to re-install APCu as your changes will be lost.

The cool service offered by Google that makes distributing your RSS feed a lot better with analytics, various RSS feed reader support and so on...<\/p><p><\/p>If you wanna use Feedburner, you just sign up for the service with your Google account on <a href=\"http:\/\/feedburner.google.com\">http:\/\/feedburner.google.com<\/a> and then provide your \"home page\" RSS feed (usually something like mywebsite.com\/?format=feed). Feedburner will in turn give you back a new RSS feed link (something like feeds.feedburner.com\/mywebsite) which you can use to \"proxy\" people who read your feeds via Feedburner and enjoy all the goodies the service can offer.\n<p>","fulltext":"<br>Now, the dead simple way to add your RSS feed link on your Joomla site is:<\/p><p><\/p>a) add the related &lt;link ... \/&gt; code on your template's &lt;head&gt;...&lt;\/head&gt; tags<p><\/p>b) use mod_custom (or some other similar extension from the Joomla Extensions Directory) to add a direct link to your Feedburner RSS feed link or a nice button to do the same thing (see for example <a href=\"http:\/\/brian.teeman.net\">http:\/\/brian.teeman.net<\/a> - \"Follow me\" button on the right column)<p><\/p>Obviously the second option is highly recommended as users who don't notice that orange or blue icon in the URL bar of their browser, can easily subscribe to your Joomla site's RSS feed.<p><\/p>But if you go with the first option too, you will end up with 3 RSS feed links listed in your &lt;head&gt; tag, that may confuse your visitors. The first feed will be your Feedburner one and the other 2 the feeds that are automatically generated by Joomla for the two available feed formats (RSS and Atom)... These 3 feed options will show up when your visitors click the orange button (e.g. in Firefox) or the blue button (e.g. on IE or Safari) in the URL bar of their browser. See the screenshot below:\n<p><\/p><div class=\"p_embed p_image_embed\">\n<img alt=\"Feed_buttons_on_url_bar\" height=\"119\" src=\"http:\/\/getfile5.posterous.com\/getfile\/files.posterous.com\/temp-2010-11-15\/odwccCekIeqlCGCBieHtfcnEdnxntDyjrIxrkAombuumfygGwgkiwtJophqB\/feed_buttons_on_url_bar.png.scaled500.png\" width=\"460\"><\/div>\n\n<p>So here's a neat trick to further control the feed link that shows up in these feed buttons on your visitors' browsers... Let's suppose you want to server the Feedburner feed link only on the \"home page\" of your Joomla site. First of all, we need a way to determine the visitor is ON the \"frontpage\" (or \"home page\", call it what you like...).<\/p>\n<p>Open up the index.php file of your Joomla template and right below the \"defined( '_JEXEC' ) or die( 'Restricted access' );\" line, add the following snippet:<\/p>\n<p><code>\n$document = &amp;JFactory::getDocument();\n\n\/\/ Determine if we are on the frontpage\n$menu = &amp;JSite::getMenu();\nif($menu-&gt;getActive() == $menu-&gt;getDefault()) $isFrontpage = true; else $isFrontpage = false;\n\n\/\/ Cleanup Joomla default feed links only for the frontpage\nif($isFrontpage) unset($document-&gt;_links);\n<\/code><\/p>\n<p>This code snippet will \"turn off\" the feed links created by Joomla (automatically) on the frontpage of your site. But only for the frontpage of your site.<\/p>\n<p>You can then go on and add your usual Feedburner feed link right before the \"&lt;jdoc:include type=\"head\" \/&gt;\" snippet within your &lt;head&gt; tag. So you end up with something like:<\/p>\n<p><code>\n&lt;link href=\"http:\/\/feeds.feedburner.com\/myfeed\" rel=\"alternate\" type=\"application\/rss+xml\" title=\"My site feed\" \/&gt;\n&lt;jdoc:include type=\"head\" \/&gt;\n<\/code><\/p>\n<p>Now when a visitor on your site requests for any other page (than the frontend), will get 3 feed links, your primary (which comes from Feedburner) and the 2 auto-generated by Joomla.<\/p>\n<p>The applications of this are limitless obviously. You can either completely disable all auto-generated Joomla feed links and pass on one common feed link on all pages, or create different Feedburner feed links and set them individually on your Joomla pages based on specific criteria (e.g. for the \"major areas\" in your site).<\/p>\n<p>You can see how implemented this trick on sites like <a href=\"http:\/\/www.gazzetta.gr\">www.gazzetta.gr<\/a> (fixed Feedburner links plus Joomla feed links), brian.teeman.net (Feedburner link only), magazine.joomla.org (Feedburner link on frontpage only).<\/p>\n","extra_fields":null,"created":"2010-11-15 16:20:00","created_by_alias":"","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","featured":"0","image":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/cf4507ae4969876df39b5f798b6f40ce_XS.jpg?t=-62169984000","imageWidth":"100","image_caption":"","image_credits":"","imageXSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/cf4507ae4969876df39b5f798b6f40ce_XS.jpg?t=-62169984000","imageSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/cf4507ae4969876df39b5f798b6f40ce_S.jpg?t=-62169984000","imageMedium":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/cf4507ae4969876df39b5f798b6f40ce_M.jpg?t=-62169984000","imageLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/cf4507ae4969876df39b5f798b6f40ce_L.jpg?t=-62169984000","imageXLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/cf4507ae4969876df39b5f798b6f40ce_XL.jpg?t=-62169984000","video":null,"video_caption":"","video_credits":"","gallery":null,"hits":"123810","category":{"id":"1","name":"Blog","alias":"blog","link":"\/blog","description":"","image":"","ordering":"1"},"tags":[{"id":"123","name":"atom","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/atom"},{"id":"124","name":"feed","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/feed"},{"id":"125","name":"feedburner","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/feedburner"},{"id":"126","name":"how-to","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/how-to"},{"id":"127","name":"rss","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/rss"}],"attachments":[],"votingPercentage":0,"numOfvotes":"(0 votes)","author":{"name":"Fotis","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/user\/989-fotis","avatar":"\/media\/k2\/users\/1563.png","profile":{"id":"1563","gender":"m","description":"","image":"1563.png","url":"","group":"1"}},"numOfComments":"1","events":{"BeforeDisplay":"","AfterDisplay":"","AfterDisplayTitle":"","BeforeDisplayContent":"","AfterDisplayContent":"","K2BeforeDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplayTitle":"","K2BeforeDisplayContent":"","K2AfterDisplayContent":"","K2CommentsCounter":""},"language":"*"},{"id":"151","title":"Joomla Pimp","alias":"joomla-pimp","link":"\/blog\/item\/151-joomla-pimp","catid":"1","introtext":"You will understand why I posted this pic after you finish reading the first paragraph in it...

One thing is clear though: development is quite slow and new significant features for the end user have not yet been introduced since the Mambo days... It's one of the reasons we decided to build K2, so we could introduce more modern and popular features into Joomla now.","fulltext":"\r\n<p>But how could the development of Joomla not be slow? Given that the core team are human beings and not robots that work 24 hours a day on coding and debugging Joomla, it's really simple to realize why the development process is slow. Additionally, it is not easy to contribute code to Joomla because there are certain protocols need to be followed that make the entire process even slower.<\/p>\r\n<p>Obviously this is not a post to bash the core team but a new thought on how we could possibly see Joomla being development in the not so distant future.<\/p>\r\n<h2>So how could we speedup Joomla development?<\/h2>\r\n<p>It's really simple. Joomla is modular by nature. So why not make development modular as well?<\/p>\r\n<p>Here's a realistic example: Joomla is made up of components like com_content (for articles), com_menus (for the menu management system), com_polls (for the polls) and so on. The Joomla team could easily \"contract\" some professional developers and have them undertake the development of a specific component or perhaps module or plugin or whatever!<\/p>\r\n<p>Imagine this: Joomla 1.6 will be released without comments (despite original claims for the opposite). How difficult would it be for some developers to create a comments component, contribute it to the default Joomla 1.6 distribution and also be responsible for maintaining the code!<\/p>\r\n<p>One thing is for sure. A lot of weight would be lifted off the core team and significantly boost Joomla's development. If a bug is introduced on the above example of the comments component, the developers of that component could issue an upgrade and deliver the upgrade through joomla.org to all Joomla users. Why update an entire Joomla website when there is a specific problem in some component?<\/p>\r\n<p>It's how things work in bigger software deployments like operating systems (OS). Teams and sub-teams developing and maintaining individual applications that make up the end product. The best example I guess is from the Linux world where there are applications developed for certain Linux distributions - the bond is so strong that you think they are actually part of the OS (see Ubuntu).<\/p>\r\n<p>To conclude, I don't think it will be hard for the Joomla core team to find such developers to code and maintain specific elements of Joomla. If others can do this in projects with a gazillion lines of code, then Joomla can do it too.<strong><br \/><\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>We (as JoomlaWorks) have offered to code (yes, code, not debug) many times and I know a lot more people who have expressed the same interest as well. And I know it's difficult for the core team to just give away SVN access to others. I wouldn't easily trust other devs to code on K2!

In practical terms: not much<\/p>\n<p>In reality it introduces a troublesome ACL, enhancements to the core of 1.5 with the addition of the jXtended libraries (already available for 1.5), there are framework changes that do make the extension of forms easier in the backend (but this is something do-able even now with some PHP, no biggie) and some tidbits here and there. Oh, not to forget! The admin theme is now blue-ish.<\/p>\n<p>Meanwhile WordPress and Drupal show significant signs of improvement and at least indicate that the people behind them take the future of their CMS very seriously. Although I don't generally agree with their marketing model, they're doing one hell of a job \"distracting\" people to them, when <strong>Joomla is far superior \"by design\"<\/strong> from these CMSs ladies and gentlemen. Just try developing your first plugin, module or whatever in Drupal or WordPress! Ha!<\/p>\n<p>Back to the Joomla world, what's the status of 1.6? Well, let's just say it's possibly not coming in 2010. There are many things that simply cannot move forward for many reasons:<\/p>\n<ul><li>too much bureaucracy?<\/li>\n<li>lack of professional involvement to stir goals and development<\/li>\n<li>boredom<\/li>\n<li>lack of money to support development<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>There may be more and -don't get me wrong- they are valid reasons, cause, hey, it's not a perfect world.<\/p>\n<p>\"So what's your point?\" you may ask...<\/p>\n<p>My point is this: forget about Joomla 1.6. Move on to Joomla 2.0.<\/p>\n<p>How do we do that? We take 1.5 and we supercharge it:<\/p>\n<ul><li>separate components into standalone applications and minimize dependance between components and the core of Joomla<\/li>\n<li>remove all the garbage (weblinks, newsfeeds, polls etc.)<\/li>\n<li>introduce the concept of \"installation profiles\", e.g. install Joomla from scratch to use as a blog or portal or whatever you want. Make it easy for professional integrators and template designers to pack websites easily. It's no biggie. This can lead to different \"sample data\" packages and content setups.<\/li>\n<li>improve the current framework in very specific points. Fix any bugs (e.g. modules not being able to attach stuff to the &lt;head&gt; of the document when the cache is on\"<\/li>\n<li>improve performance. The work is there. Klas has pointed out the weaknesses of the current caching layer. Add his fixes in and move on. Next stop will be to better handle application load (and server load) when we have cases where users need to be logged in and therefore the cache cannot work. Maybe a mechanism to select which elements to cache or a mechanism similar to what Ning uses: Cache everything and attach some query strings to certain user-interaction related links so that the application fetches fresh content. This is a simple, tried and tested way.<\/li>\n<li>Create a unified installer for everything. Use the concept of the manifest.xml file to install 1,2,3 or 12 extensions at a time. That way you can install a plugin and 2 accompanying modules without telling the user to install them separately or write a component to act as the intermediate.<\/li>\n<li>Forget com_content. Want more? Use K2 for core content. It's completely separated from the core yet 100% tied to the framework. It doesn't suck with menu item ids. It's veeery familiar to com_content. This will boost 1.5's features to 2.0-ish and slap Drupal and WordPress in the face. Think comments and tags and basic content ACL is difficult? Come on? It's all about decision making.<\/li>\n<li>Internationalization: include the excellent \"unicode slugs\" plugin from Jean-Marie Simonet to create unicode capable URLs. It's here already and it's free under GPL.<\/li>\n<li>Extend the default \"content elements\" for all extensions so that less experienced devs can create a simple plugin that has a \"content category\" selector which doesn't suck.<\/li>\n<li>Improve the media manager a bit with the addition of more actions. Upload and delete is not enough.<\/li>\n<li>Add a new admin template that just doesn't suck. There are many people out there that have fresh ideas and can significantly help. Sticking to the same Mambo-like pattern just doesn't cut it anymore.<\/li>\n<li>Make all Joomla 1.5 extensions and templates MVC capable so that template devs can rip the thing out and create amazing templates both for the frontend and the backend.<\/li>\n<\/ul><p>There are more to be added of course and I got a whole list for that, but these are the most important perhaps.<\/p>\n<p>The key word here of course is \"initiative\". I believe that software development is like real life relationships. If you drag the thing over and over it will eventually lead to a break up. You have to be able to transform when circumstances demand.<\/p>\n<p>What are your thoughts?<\/p>\n<p><em><strong>P.S.

So we need to install (unfortunately) the Ingres Community Database (as the PECL Ingres package seems to require it to be installed) and of course we need to install PHP's package for Ingres (PECL Ingres) so we can query an Ingres database from PHP. Still with me?<\/p>\n<p>Let's get started...<\/p>\n<p><strong>1. Install Ingres and PHP\/Ingres support on CentOS:<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Install Ingres DB Community Edition first as it's obviously required by PECL's Ingres package. Here we install the related RPM for a 32-bit CentOS machine. The process is the same for 64-bit, the file is just different. Sign up on ingres.com for a free account and go to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.ingres.com\/downloads\/ingres-database.php\">http:\/\/www.ingres.com\/downloads\/ingres-database.php<\/a> to download the right release. Ingres.com is passing the download link from some script, so if you wanna pinpoint the URL and not download the file to your PC, then upload onto your server, you can simply right-click on the download manager in Firefox and copy the \"link location\". This will give you the URL where the actual file of the Ingres db relies on the ingres.com site, so you can use \"wget\". In this case, the path I got was something like \"http:\/\/98.129.177.132\/~GqxCOi\/ingres-10.0.0-119-NPTL-gpl-pc-linux-i386.tgz\". Don't try this link in particular as it may not work when you read this...<\/p>\n<p>You obviously need root access to the server:<\/p>\n<div class=\"CodeRay\">\n  <div class=\"code\"><pre># cd \/usr\/src\n# wget http:\/\/98.129.177.132\/~GqxCOi\/ingres-10.0.0-119-NPTL-gpl-pc-linux-i386.tgz\n# tar -zxvf ingres-10.0.0-119-NPTL-gpl-pc-linux-i386.tgz\n# cd ingres-10.0.0-119-NPTL-gpl-pc-linux-i386\n# sh ingres_express_install.sh<\/pre><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<p>This process will install Ingres in <strong>\/opt\/Ingres\/IngresII\/<\/strong><p \/><strong>2. Install the PECL Ingres package for PHP.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Using \"pecl install ingres\" will simply <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">NOT<\/span> work. So we do it the old-fashioned way. Grab the latest package here: <a href=\"http:\/\/pecl.php.net\/package\/ingres\">http:\/\/pecl.php.net\/package\/ingres<\/a> and then do the following:<\/p>\n<div class=\"CodeRay\">\n  <div class=\"code\"><pre># cd \/usr\/src\n# wget http:\/\/pecl.php.net\/get\/ingres-2.2.2.tgz\n# tar -zxvf ingres-2.2.2.tgz\n# cd ingres-2.2.2\n# phpize\n# .\/configure --with-ingres=\/opt\/Ingres\/IngresII\n# make\n# make install<\/pre><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<p>This process will install the PECL Ingres package for PHP.<p \/><strong>We need a couple more things, before we get started.<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>We need to declare some system variables in Apache. If you use WHM\/CPanel, go to Main &gt;&gt; Service Configuration &gt;&gt; Apache Configuration &gt;&gt; Include Editor and choose to edit the \"Pre Main Include\" file. Add the following 2 lines:<\/p>\n<div class=\"CodeRay\">\n  <div class=\"code\"><pre>SetEnv II_SYSTEM \/opt\/Ingres\/IngresII\nSetEnv LD_LIBRARY_PATH \/opt\/Ingres\/IngresII\/ingres\/lib<\/pre><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<p>If you don't use Cpanel, just paste these lines into your httpd.conf file.<p \/>Now locate the WHM\/CPanel php.ini file at \/usr\/local\/lib\/php.ini (if you don't use WHM\/Cpanel it's probably located in \/usr\/lib\/php.ini). Find the line \"; Directory in which the loadable extensions (modules) reside.\" and right after that add:<\/p>\n<div class=\"CodeRay\">\n  <div class=\"code\"><pre>extension = &quot;ingres.so&quot;<\/pre><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<p>This will make sure the related PHP extension for Ingres support is loaded by PHP.<p \/>That's it.<p \/>Go to your \"public_html\" folder (or any other folder) and test if you got Ingres support for PHP installed properly. We'll use a dummy connection file, so get the code below:<\/p>\n<div class=\"CodeRay\">\n  <div class=\"code\"><pre>&lt;?php\n$link = ingres_connect(&quot;database&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;password&quot;)\u00a0 or die(&quot;Could not connect: &quot; . ingres_error($link));\necho &quot;Connected successfully&quot;;\n?&gt;<\/pre><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<p>&hellip;and save this as \"<strong>ingres.php<\/strong>\". Now visit this file from your browser and if you get a \"<em>Warning: ingres_connect()..<\/em>.\" then it means Ingress support for PHP is installed properly!<p \/>Enjoy!<\/p>\n  ","fulltext":"","extra_fields":null,"created":"2010-03-16 19:50:00","created_by_alias":"","modified":"0000-00-00 00:00:00","featured":"0","image":"","imageWidth":"100","image_caption":"","image_credits":"","imageXSmall":"","imageSmall":"","imageMedium":"","imageLarge":"","imageXLarge":"","video":null,"video_caption":"","video_credits":"","gallery":null,"hits":"65919","category":{"id":"1","name":"Blog","alias":"blog","link":"\/blog","description":"","image":"","ordering":"1"},"tags":[{"id":"86","name":"centos","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/centos"},{"id":"87","name":"cpanel","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/cpanel"},{"id":"161","name":"ingres","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/ingres"},{"id":"91","name":"pecl","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/pecl"},{"id":"162","name":"php","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/php"},{"id":"163","name":"whm","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/whm"}],"attachments":[],"votingPercentage":0,"numOfvotes":"(0 votes)","author":{"name":"Fotis","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/user\/989-fotis","avatar":"\/media\/k2\/users\/1563.png","profile":{"id":"1563","gender":"m","description":"","image":"1563.png","url":"","group":"1"}},"numOfComments":"4","events":{"BeforeDisplay":"","AfterDisplay":"","AfterDisplayTitle":"","BeforeDisplayContent":"","AfterDisplayContent":"","K2BeforeDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplayTitle":"","K2BeforeDisplayContent":"","K2AfterDisplayContent":"","K2CommentsCounter":""},"language":"*"},{"id":"135","title":"Replace Mootools in Joomla with a compressed copy from Google AJAX Libraries API","alias":"replace-mootools-in-joomla-with-a-compressed","link":"\/blog\/item\/135-replace-mootools-in-joomla-with-a-compressed","catid":"1","introtext":"\n    <p><img src=\"http:\/\/images.sixrevisions.com\/2009\/09\/28-06_google_ajax_libraries.png\" alt=\"Google AJAX Libraries API\" \/><\/p>\n<p>Here's an easy trick to replace the built-in Mootools library that comes in Joomla 1.5 with a compressed copy from Google AJAX Libraries API:<\/p>\n<div class=\"CodeRay\">\n  <div class=\"code\"><pre>&lt;!-- The following code goes into your template's index.php &lt;head&gt; tags, right before the &lt;jdoc:include type=&quot;head&quot; \/&gt; code block --&gt;&lt;?php\/\/ Replace Mootools in Joomla with a compressed copy from Google AJAX Libraries API$document =&amp;JFactory::getDocument();unset($document-&gt;_scripts[$this-&gt;baseurl .

Do not assume you'll always be the one coding for a particular site. Never use generic names for classes, IDs and form names in your code like &ldquo;comment&rdquo; or &ldquo;article&rdquo;. Someone else may do so too, so you can kiss your app&rsquo;s functionality bye-bye!<\/li>\r\n<li>Avoid inline CSS like the plague.<\/li>\r\n<li>Try to squeeze as much CSS code as possible into one file. Less CSS files means faster loading of your site's design on the browser.<\/li>\r\n<li>Avoid placing UI images inside your HTML code. UI images belong to given UI templates (home, category lists, product catalog, article etc.) and therefore are loaded on every page request. Placing such images as \"background images\" in your CSS file allows the browser to cache them the first time it renders them, which means your site will load faster on subsequent requests for your visitors.<\/li>\r\n<li>Avoid inline JavaScript. Use CSS IDs or classes to attache JavaScript behaviour where necessary.<\/li>\r\n<li>Try to squeeze as much JavaScript code as possible into one file<\/li>\r\n<li>Don&rsquo;t execute JavaScript code when not needed! E.g. if you apply behaviour to a certain block of code and this block of code does not exist on all your pages, make sure you check if this block of code exists by using a simple check for the block's container ID or class. You can do that pretty easily with jQuery or Mootools these days.<\/li>\r\n<li>Avoid inline CSS inside your JavaScript code. Stick to classes and IDs. Don&rsquo;t inject too much HTML markup if possible. Try to alter the behaviour of your app by adding\/removing CSS classes\/IDs. Avoid hardcoded language strings inside JS code if you plan to make your site multilingual in the near future.<\/li>\r\n<li>If you code on PHP, check out the Tidy library. Enable it when you can as it will easily point out (and fix) bad markup in your HTML.<\/li>\r\n<li>For God&rsquo;s sake use an open source CMS, don&rsquo;t re-invent the wheel, make it possible to contribute back. Joomla, Drupal, Wordpress are enterprise class CMSs to get started with and some of the most popular websites in the world are powered by these open source CMSs.<\/li>\r\n<\/ol>","fulltext":"","extra_fields":null,"created":"2009-12-17 16:50:00","created_by_alias":"","modified":"2015-04-02 21:10:29","featured":"0","image":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/8da476f72f06a276b1f930cdb28c21f1_XS.jpg?t=1428009029","imageWidth":"100","image_caption":"","image_credits":"","imageXSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/8da476f72f06a276b1f930cdb28c21f1_XS.jpg?t=1428009029","imageSmall":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/8da476f72f06a276b1f930cdb28c21f1_S.jpg?t=1428009029","imageMedium":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/8da476f72f06a276b1f930cdb28c21f1_M.jpg?t=1428009029","imageLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/8da476f72f06a276b1f930cdb28c21f1_L.jpg?t=1428009029","imageXLarge":"\/media\/k2\/items\/cache\/8da476f72f06a276b1f930cdb28c21f1_XL.jpg?t=1428009029","video":null,"video_caption":"","video_credits":"","gallery":null,"hits":"61404","category":{"id":"1","name":"Blog","alias":"blog","link":"\/blog","description":"","image":"","ordering":"1"},"tags":[{"id":"171","name":"ten commandments","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/ten%20commandments"},{"id":"96","name":"tips","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/tips"},{"id":"172","name":"web development","published":"1","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/tag\/web%20development"}],"attachments":[],"votingPercentage":0,"numOfvotes":"(0 votes)","author":{"name":"Fotis","link":"\/blog\/itemlist\/user\/989-fotis","avatar":"\/media\/k2\/users\/1563.png","profile":{"id":"1563","gender":"m","description":"","image":"1563.png","url":"","group":"1"}},"numOfComments":"1","events":{"BeforeDisplay":"","AfterDisplay":"","AfterDisplayTitle":"","BeforeDisplayContent":"","AfterDisplayContent":"","K2BeforeDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplay":"","K2AfterDisplayTitle":"","K2BeforeDisplayContent":"","K2AfterDisplayContent":"","K2CommentsCounter":""},"language":"*"},{"id":"128","title":"Properly preventing ?tp=1 on Joomla sites using PHP only","alias":"properly-preventing-tp1-on-joomla-sites-using","link":"\/blog\/item\/128-properly-preventing-tp1-on-joomla-sites-using","catid":"1","introtext":"\n    <p>I was recently looking for a clean solution to prevent the display of module positions on gazzetta.gr - the 2nd most high traffic Joomla website, after joomla.org.<\/p>\n<p>The first thing that came to mind was the htaccess trick I had spotted on the Joomla forums here: <a href=\"http:\/\/forum.joomla.org\/viewtopic.php?p=1887090#p1887090\">http:\/\/forum.joomla.org\/viewtopic.php?p=1887090#p1887090<\/a><\/p>\n<p>Thing is, this rule does not work if you have SEF on and you&rsquo;re in some inside page.<\/p>\n<p>So I just wrote a simple solution which is PHP based and you can include right at the top of your Joomla template for ease of maintenance (template designers can use this too as an XML option ;) )&hellip;<\/p>\n<p>Make sure the following code goes at the very top of your template's index.php file, but within &lt;?php and ?&gt; tags:<\/p>\n<div class=\"CodeRay\">\n  <div class=\"code\"><pre>\/\/ Properly prevent ?tp=1 module position exposure on Joomla sites using PHP only$currentURL = explode('?',substr(JURI::base(),0,-1).$_SERVER['REQUEST_URI']);if($_GET['tp']) header('Location: '.$currentURL[0]);<\/pre><\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n<p><a href=\"http:\/\/www.gazzetta.gr\/component\/k2\/item\/59889-%CE%B7-%CF%87%CF%81%CF%85%CF%83%CE%AE-%CE%BC%CF%80%CE%AC%CE%BB%CE%B1-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7%CE%BD-%CE%BB%CE%BF%CF%85%CF%84%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%AC%CE%BD%CE%B1?tp=1\" target=\"_blank\">Check it out here<\/a><\/p>\n<p><strong>UPDATE:<\/strong> There seems to be a Joomla API solution for that.
